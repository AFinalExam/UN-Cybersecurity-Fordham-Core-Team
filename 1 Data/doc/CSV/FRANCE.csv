54,FRANCE.pdf,9, It leads to transformation in most trades
55,FRANCE.pdf,9," It transforms sectors of activity and bu- sinesses, giving them more flexibility and competi- tiveness"

57,FRANCE.pdf,9, These sectors are simultaneously more exposed to digital threats
58,FRANCE.pdf,9,", Doing without digital technology or the lack of access to it, results in a form of economic and social exclusion"
59,FRANCE.pdf,9," Similarly, the sovereignty of a State that does not have the autonomy required in the digital sector would be threatened For digital technology to remain an area of freedom, exchanges and growth"

63,FRANCE.pdf,9,"An initial cybersecurity strategy was developed in France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011 shortly after the discovery of a cyberattack, the inten- tion of which was to spy on the economic and finance ministries"
64,FRANCE.pdf,9," The attackers who had been acting for se- veral months had taken control of the core of one of the ministerial networks and were regularly collecting political, economic and financial information"
65,FRANCE.pdf,9,"This type of cyberattack targets - many French, bu- sinesses of all sizes in all sectors of activity"
66,FRANCE.pdf,9," Businesses - are also the target of all types of fraud, such as malware infection"
