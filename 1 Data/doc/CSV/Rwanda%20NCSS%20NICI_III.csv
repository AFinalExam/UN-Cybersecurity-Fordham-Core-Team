1500,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, NICI Pillars and Projects
1501,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, The large scope of NICI strategy & plan demands an organising principle
1502,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79," However, the link between pillars and lead agencies became more tenuous during NICI II implementation process, and this was pointed out as a possible reason why the project status varied considerably between different pillars"
1503,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, It also may explain lack of coordination under NICI II
1504,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, Some lessons learned for overall plan implementation include Lack of a committed leader in each pillar with the responsibility and authority to guide implementation of all the projects within his or her brief Lack of involvement of pillar/focus area communities that constantly monitor and support the implementation effort
1505,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79,Lack of ownership of initiatives by stakeholders
1506,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, Lack of close coordination across areas which would have ensured that dependencies and sequencing of activities were appropriate
1507,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79,Nici Outcomes and Impacts 
1508,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79,"While there are many positive stories from NICI II projects, there have been little objective and verifiable evidences to verify these claims"
1509,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79," NICI II projects had clear outputs, but almost no indicators to measure outcomes and impacts"
1510,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, One result of this has been real difficulty on carrying out an independent evaluation of NICI II
1511,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79,", But, more importantly, the lack of measurement at output and outcome levels prevented effective monitoring of progress, financial and operational and evaluation in relation to ultimate goals"
1512,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79," This needs to be remedied under NICI III, implementation, process"
1513,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, During NICI I and II implementation the institution mandated to manage the process
1514,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, ( RITA ) underwent considerable institutional and management change
1515,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, The mandate and functions of RITA was transferred to the new Rwanda Development Board under RDB/ICT
1516,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, Organizational restructuring was not complete until recently
1517,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, This has made it challenging for the smooth and coordinated NICI II project implementation
1518,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, The NICI II evaluation pointed out this fact and called for a stable and clear governance structure to be put in place and made clear to all stakeholders
1519,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79," At the operational level, NICI II evaluation pointed out several challenges in Governance, which include Detailed project, selection and sequencing, based On dependencies were not clearly defined, "
1520,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79,Lack of staff and changing relations with collaborating MDAs made it very difficult to manage and execute an ambitious set of projects
1521,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79," Project analysis and design was not elaborated need for results, based framework, ( or logical analysis framework ) with objectives inputs, outputs, practical indicators of successful achievement of outputs and outcomes, targets for achievement, etc"
1522,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,79, Lack of information sharing and weak project management consolidated project management information was not shared among stakeholders to improve relevant projects

1526,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,80, Feedback from NICI II evaluation clearly pointed out the importance of structured M & E to capture real outcomes of the NICI initiatives
1527,Rwanda%20NCSS%20NICI_III.pdf,80, The evaluation also pointed to the fact that a coordinated M & E approach between RDB/ICT and MINICT is essential under NICI III
