26,GHANA.pdf,7," The expansion of Internet access in Africa, representing the largest growth in the world, means more people today have access to Internet, with its attendant risks of attack from people with disruptive tendencies to defraud other Internet users and commit cybercrimes"
27,GHANA.pdf,7," These disruptive activities by cyber criminals has caused the debate on cyber security to be on the top of the agenda for almost every country, and many countries are strategizing on how to combat the cyber criminals"
28,GHANA.pdf,7, Several global initiatives are also addressing cyber crime and enhancement of cyber security
29,GHANA.pdf,7, The ITUs IMPACT program is providing several member countries early warning on cyber crimes and is helping these member countries secure their cyber space

32,GHANA.pdf,7, The cyber menace in Ghana has been more of cyber fraud
33,GHANA.pdf,7,", The popular sakawa, where cyber criminals defraud unsuspecting Internet users of large sums of money in Ghana and abroad remains prevalent because of inadequate laws on cyber crime to prosecute cyber criminals"
34,GHANA.pdf,7, The Electronic Transaction Act ( 2008
35,GHANA.pdf,7, ) has provisions for law enforcement agencies to fight cyber crime
36,GHANA.pdf,7," However, this is not adequate for law enforcement in the fight against cyber crime, as there are legal gaps caused by rapidly change in the cyber landscape"
37,GHANA.pdf,7," There is, however, the need to fully address all aspects of cyber security and apply a multi-stakeholder approach to fighting the cyber menace"
38,GHANA.pdf,7," Several initiatives are on-going to address the cyber menace, all of which need to be brought under one umbrella for Ghana"
39,GHANA.pdf,7," The Ministry of Communications Ghana, with the support of UN Economic Commission for Africa ( UNECA ), began a process in 2011 to review some aspects of Ghanas ICT for Accelerated Development, ( ICT4AD ) policy to identify gaps"

53,GHANA.pdf,10," In recent times, Ghana has experienced a number of cyber attacks, including defacing of a number of government websites by Internet hackers"
54,GHANA.pdf,10, These attacks have a denting effect on the cyber image of Ghana and are indications of security weakness of our cyber infrastructure and space
55,GHANA.pdf,10," Cyber attacks have become very sophisticated and widespread, and many countries are not only focusing on protecting their critical information infrastructure, but also ensuring that there are very good incidence, responds teams in place to respond to incidents cyber security incidents"
56,GHANA.pdf,10," Since the turn of the century, we have seen a rapid growth of the Internet in Ghana"
57,GHANA.pdf,10," The growth has brought in its wake extensive cyber activities and subsequently attacks on various information infrastructure, as well as cyber fraud, popularly known as Sakawa"
58,GHANA.pdf,10," The biggest challenge is that the designated central point in the country where victims of Sakawa can report to at the Police, CID Cybercrime Unit is not visible nationally and is under resourced"
59,GHANA.pdf,10, In cases when these incidences had been reported
60,GHANA.pdf,10, It has taken many years to apprehend any suspect because of the lack of expertise in tracking these criminals using computersbased forensic skills
61,GHANA.pdf,10, To make matters worse
62,GHANA.pdf,10," When such cyber criminals were apprehended and processed to court, there are more often not enough legal basis to prosecute these criminal"
63,GHANA.pdf,10, As the legal system is inadequate to convict and punish cyber criminals
64,GHANA.pdf,10,", Consequently, Ghanas image continues dwindle in cyberspace and is therefore considered as a cyber crime prone country"

70,GHANA.pdf,11, Ghanas mobile penetration stood at 115
71,GHANA.pdf,11,64 % as at the end of March 2015
72,GHANA.pdf,11, The high mobile penetration has brought about an increase in mobile phone threats and fraud
73,GHANA.pdf,11," The increased use of smart phones, especially with the introduction of M-commerce, is likely to bring more incidents like hackings and other attacks to mobile phone users"
74,GHANA.pdf,11, There is therefore a need to create awareness of risk of cyber attacks and exploitations for mobile users
75,GHANA.pdf,11, As a result of mobile fraud
76,GHANA.pdf,11," The National Communications Authority registered all SIM card in Ghana, but there still remain high crime in the mobile space, as cyber criminal continue to engage SIM Box fraud and other fraudulent activities"
77,GHANA.pdf,11," Until recently, Ghanas Internet backbone and resources have been largely private sector driven"
78,GHANA.pdf,11," This result has been that many government officials send and receiving highly sensitive government information using free email services such Yahoo and Google, making it vulnerable to information theft"
79,GHANA.pdf,11," However, since 2008, with the establishment of the National Information Technology Agency, ( NITA ) Ghana embarked on a massive government network rollout to ensure efficiency in government operations and improved service delivery to citizens"
80,GHANA.pdf,11," The result is that NITA now has Internet and Data services to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, ( MDAs ) and has national datacenter facilities that enable NITA provide email and webhosting services under government designated second level domain"

87,GHANA.pdf,12," Countries which have high levels of networked computers and automation, stand greater risks than countries with less developed"
88,GHANA.pdf,12, As many countries with less developed network infrastructure strive to become a knowledge society
89,GHANA.pdf,12, Many network infrastructures will be rolled out with automation

91,GHANA.pdf,12, Fiber optic backbones are being rolled out
92,GHANA.pdf,12, An increase in network computer infrastructure will bring a proportionate risk to critical information
93,GHANA.pdf,12," For many years, many countries with high degree of networked computer infrastructure have been working around securing their critical information infrastructure and have developed cyber security policies and strategies to mitigate cyber incidences and crimes"
94,GHANA.pdf,12, No one country control cyber space and everyone from anywhere in the world can access information from the Internet
95,GHANA.pdf,12," It is therefore very important that countries put in place robust security around critical national information infrastructure and set up very swift response systems, as risk of attacks cannot be eliminated"
96,GHANA.pdf,12," Additionally, using an international approach of cooperation to secure cyber space and mitigate cyber crimes is also essential"
97,GHANA.pdf,12," Many countries with high networked computer infrastructure and global companies already have Computer Security Incidents, Response Teams, ( CSIRTs ) in place where responses to cyber incidences are coordinated to mitigate the impact of cyber incidences"
