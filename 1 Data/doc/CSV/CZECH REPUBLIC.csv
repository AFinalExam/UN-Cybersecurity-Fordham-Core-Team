30,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5,Ensuring cyber security of a state constitutes one of the key challenges of the present day
31,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5, The public and private sectors' dependence on information and communication technologies becomes ever more obvious
32,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5, Information sharing and protection are crucial for the protection of security and economic interests of the state and its citizens
33,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5,", Whilst the general public is mostly concerned about their personal data, abuse or afraid of losing money and data"
34,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5, Cyber security as such encompasses much more
35,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5," Major risks include cyber espionage, (, industrial, military, political or other ), ever more often carried out directly by governments or their security agencies, organized crime in cyberspace, hacktivism, intentional disinformation campaigns with political or military objectives, and even in the future"
36,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5," Beside cyber attacks, frequently motivated by financial benefit"
37,CZECH REPUBLIC.pdf,5," Cyber security, can also be compromised by unintended disruptions of network security and integrity due to, for instance, human factor, failures or natural disasters"
