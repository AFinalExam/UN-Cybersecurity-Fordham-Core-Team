98,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,7, Some states have been widely accused of using cyber attacks to coincide with and magnify the effects of traditional military operations
99,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,7, These cyber attack programs are typically designed to sabotage an adversarys infrastructure and communications
100,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,7, They may also support electronic attacks on an adversarys military equipment and operations
101,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,7, Cyber attacks that disrupt emergency response and public health systems would put lives in danger
102,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,7, Canada and our allies understand that addressing these risks requires modernizing our military doctrines

162,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10," Canadas academic, community, non-governmental organi-, zations and private sector must join the Government in securing Canadas cyber systems"
163,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10, Each of these communities has unique technological and analytical capabilities to offer and a strong incentive to secure their own systems
164,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10," Their collaboration is essential to our shared success, to secure Canada and increase our productivity and prosperity"
165,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10, Individual Canadians must also play a primary role in securing Canadas cyber future
166,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10," The Government can intro- duce and support important cyber security initiatives, but it cannot protect each of us from every threat we encounter when we go online"
167,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10, Canadians must become aware of these threats and of the tools available to recognize and avoid them
168,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,10," Most importantly, they must use these tools to protect themselves and their families"

178,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,11," And the Government, transmits highly classified information essential to our military and national security operations via its classified communications systems"
179,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,11, There have been many cyber attacks directed at Government systems
180,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,11, Cyber attackers regularly probe these systems looking for vulnerabilities
181,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,11, Securing these links is not simply a matter of operational efficiency
182,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,11," It is a matter of national security and sovereignty, protecting the lives of our foreign service, military and law enforcement personnel, the integrity of our economy and safeguarding the personal information of Canadians"

231,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,13, Failure to do so will have adverse economic impacts and undermine consumer confidence
232,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,13, A 2008 study by McMaster University9 on identity theft in Canada found that 20 % of consumers have eliminated or reduced the amount of shopping they do online and that 9 % have eliminated or reduced online banking activities due to the risks they perceive in doing business online
233,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,13, By building a secure and trusted business environment we will help foster the productivity and innovation that drive our economic prosperity
234,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,13, The public needs to be more aware of the vulnerabilities inherent in the cyber systems that these industries use to deliver their services
235,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,13, Increased awareness will equip Canadians to avoid identity theft and potential financial loss
236,Canada_2010_cbr-scrt-strtgy-eng.pdf,13," The Government will partner with the provinces, territories and private sector to improve the cyber security posture of Canada and Canadians"
