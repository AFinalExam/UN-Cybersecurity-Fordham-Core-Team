23,uk.pdf,6,The UK is one of the worlds leading digital nations
24,uk.pdf,6, Much of our prosperity now depends on our ability to secure our technology data and networks from the many threats we face
25,uk.pdf,6," Yet cyber attacks are growing, more frequent, sophisticated and damaging when they succeed"
26,uk.pdf,6, So we are taking decisive action to protect both our economy and the privacy of UK citizens
27,uk.pdf,6, Our National Cyber Security Strategy sets out our plan to make Britain confident capable and resilient in a fast-moving digital world
28,uk.pdf,6," Over the lifetime of this five-year strategy, we will invest 1"

30,uk.pdf,6, We need a comprehensive response
31,uk.pdf,6," We will focus on raising the cost of mounting an attack against anyone in the UK, both through stronger defences and better cyber skills"
32,uk.pdf,6," This is no longer just an issue for the IT department, but for the whole workforce"
33,uk.pdf,6, Cyber skills need to reach into every profession
34,uk.pdf,6," The new National Cyber Security Centre will provide a hub of world-class user-friendly expertise for businesses and individuals, as well as rapid response to major incidents"

62,uk.pdf,9, The challenge of our generation is to build a flourishing digital society that is both resilient to cyber threats and equipped with the knowledge and capabilities required to maximise opportunities and manage risks
63,uk.pdf,9,We are critically dependent on the Internet
64,uk.pdf,9,", However, it is inherently insecure and there will always be attempts to exploit weaknesses to launch cyber attacks"
65,uk.pdf,9," This threat cannot be eliminated completely, but the risk can be greatly reduced to a level that allows society to continue to prosper and benefit from the huge opportunities that digital technology brings"
66,uk.pdf,9, The 2011 National Cyber Security 
67,uk.pdf,9,"Strategy, underpinned by the British Governments, 860m National Cyber Security Programme, has delivered substantial improvements to UK cyber security"
68,uk.pdf,9, It achieved important outcomes by looking to the market to drive secure cyber behaviours
69,uk.pdf,9,", But this approach has not achieved the scale and pace of change required to stay ahead of the fast moving threat"
70,uk.pdf,9, We now need to go further
71,uk.pdf,9,"Our vision for 2021 is that the UK is secure and resilient to cyber threats, prosperous and confident in the digital world"
72,uk.pdf,9," To realise this vision, we will work to achieve the following objectives: DEFEND We have the "

107,uk.pdf,13,13 Information and communication 
108,uk.pdf,13,Technologies have evolved over the last two decades and are now integrated into virtually every aspect of our lives
109,uk.pdf,13, The UK is a digitalised society
110,uk.pdf,13, Our economy and our daily lives are the richer for it
111,uk.pdf,13, The transformation brought about by this digitalisation creates new dependencies
112,uk.pdf,13," Our economy, the administration of government and the provision of essential services now rely on the integrity of cyberspace and on the infrastructure systems and data which underpin it"
113,uk.pdf,13," A loss of trust in that integrity would jeopardise the benefits of this technological revolution, determination to address cyber threats and put in place tough and innovative measures as a world leader in cyber security"
114,uk.pdf,13," This National Cyber Security Strategy delivers on that commitment In preparing this new strategy, "
115,uk.pdf,13,"The Government is building on the achievements, objectives and judgements of the first five-year National Cyber Security Strategy issued in 2011"
116,uk.pdf,13, The Government invested 860m over that period and is proud of what has been achieved
117,uk.pdf,13," The policies, institutions and initiatives developed over the last five years have helped to establish the UK as a leading global player in cyber security"
118,uk.pdf,13,"Much of the hardware and software originally developed to facilitate this interconnected digital environment has prioritised efficiency, cost and the convenience of the user, but has not always had security designed in from the start"
119,uk.pdf,13," Hostile states, criminal or terrorist organisations and individuals can exploit the gap between convenience and security"
120,uk.pdf,13, Narrowing that gap is a national priority
121,uk.pdf,13, These are sound foundations
122,uk.pdf,13,But the persistence and ingenuity of those who would threaten us the prevalence of our vulnerabilities and gaps in our capabilities and defences mean we need to work even harder to keep pace with the threat
123,uk.pdf,13, A comprehensive approach is required if we are to effectively secure our cyber interests
124,uk.pdf,13," Our resolution to make further investment and interventions is based on the following assessments: The expansion of the Internet, "
125,uk.pdf,13,Beyond computers and mobile phones into other cyber-physical or smart systems is extending the threat of remote exploitation to a whole host of new technologies
126,uk.pdf,13," Systems and technologies that underpin our daily lives, such as power grids, air traffic control systems, satellites, medical technologies, industrial plants and traffic lights Are connected to the Internet and therefore potentially vulnerable to interference The 2015 National Security "
127,uk.pdf,13,"Strategy, ( NSS ) reaffirmed the cyber threat as a Tier One risk to UK interests"
128,uk.pdf,13," The NSS set out the Governments, the scale and dynamic nature of cyber threats and our vulnerability and dependency mean that maintaining the current approach will not in itself be sufficient to keep us safe"
129,uk.pdf,13, A market based approach to the promotion of cyber hygiene has not produced the required pace and scale of change
130,uk.pdf,13," Therefore, Government has to lead the way and intervene more directly by bringing its influence and resources to bear to address cyber threats"

137,uk.pdf,14,"This strategy is intended to shape the Governments policy, while also offering a coherent and compelling vision to share with the public and private sector, civil society, academia and the wider population"
138,uk.pdf,14, The strategy covers the whole of the UK
139,uk.pdf,14," The UK Government will seek to ensure the strategy is implemented for all parts of the UK, recognising that, to the extent that it touches on devolved matters, we will work closely with the devolved Governments on its application to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ( respecting the three Separate legal jurisdictions and four education systems that exist in the UK ), Where proposals set out in the strategy relate to devolved matters"
140,uk.pdf,14, Their implementation will be agreed as appropriate with those Governments in accordance with the devolution settlements
141,uk.pdf,14,The strategy sets out proposed or recommended actions aimed at all sectors of the economy and society from central government departments to leaders across industry and the individual citizen

144,uk.pdf,15,Cyber security at all levels for our collective benefit and will be the basis on which the UK engages internationally to promote good internet governance In this strategy
145,uk.pdf,15," Cyber security refers to the protection of information systems, ( hardware, software and associated infrastructure, ) the data on them and the services they provide from unauthorised access, harm or misuse"
146,uk.pdf,15, This includes harm caused intentionally by the operator of the system or accidentally as a result of failing to follow security procedures
147,uk.pdf,15,"Consistent with our assessment of the challenge we face and building on the achievements of the 2011 strategy, this document sets out our updated assessment of the "

154,uk.pdf,17,"National Cyber Security Strategy, 2016Section 3 STRATEGIC CONTEXT"
155,uk.pdf,17,", When the last National Cyber Security Strategy was published in 2011, the scale of technological change and its impact was already apparent"
156,uk.pdf,17, The trends and opportunities described then have since accelerated
157,uk.pdf,17,", New technologies and applications have come to the fore and greater uptake of internet-based technologies worldwide, in particular in developing countries, has offered increasing opportunities for economic and social development"
158,uk.pdf,17, These developments have brought or will bring significant advantages to connected societies such as ours
159,uk.pdf,17,", But as our reliance on networks in the UK and overseas grows, so do the opportunities for those who would seek to compromise our systems and data"
160,uk.pdf,17," Equally, the geopolitical landscape has changed"
161,uk.pdf,17, Malicious cyber activity knows no international boundaries
162,uk.pdf,17, State actors are experimenting with offensive
163,uk.pdf,17, Cyber criminals are broadening their efforts and expanding their strategic modus operandi
164,uk.pdf,17," To achieve higher value pay-outs from UK citizens, organisations and institutions"
165,uk.pdf,17, Terrorists and their sympathisers are conducting low-level attacks and aspire to carry out more significant acts
166,uk.pdf,17," This chapter sets out our assessment of the nature of these threats, our vulnerabilities and how these continue to evolve"
167,uk.pdf,17,"This strategy deals with cyber crime in the context of two interrelated forms of criminal activity, cyber-dependent crimes, crimes, "
168,uk.pdf,17,That can be committed only through the use of Information and Communications Technology
169,uk.pdf,17," ( ICT ) devices, where the devices are both the tool for committing the crime and the target of the crime"
170,uk.pdf,17," developing and propagating malware for financial gain, hacking to steal damage, distort or destroy data, and/or network or activity ) and cyber-enabled crimes"
171,uk.pdf,17,"Crimes which can be increased in scale or reach by the use of computers, computer networks or other forms of ICT (, such as cyber-enabled fraud and data theft, ) "
172,uk.pdf,17,"Much of the most serious cyber crime, mainly fraud theft and extortion against the UK, continues to be perpetrated predominantly by financially motivated Russian-language organised criminal groups, ( OCGs ) in Eastern Europe, with many of the criminal marketplace, services being hosted in these countries"
173,uk.pdf,18," However, the threat also emanates from other countries and regions and from inside the UK itself, with emerging threats from South Asia and West Africa of increasing concern National Cyber Security Strategy, 2016Section 3STRATEGIC CONTEXT"
174,uk.pdf,18,"18, Even when key individuals "
175,uk.pdf,18,Responsible for the most damaging cyber criminal activities against the UK are identified
176,uk.pdf,18, It is often difficult for the UK and international law enforcement agencies to prosecute them when they are located in jurisdictions with limited or no extradition arrangements
177,uk.pdf,18, These OCGs are principally 
178,uk.pdf,18,"Responsible for developing and deploying the increasingly advanced malware that infects the computers and networks of UK citizens, our industry and government"
179,uk.pdf,18," The impact is dispersed throughout the UK, but the cumulative effect is significant"
180,uk.pdf,18," These attacks are becoming increasingly aggressive and confrontational, as illustrated by the increasing use of ransomware and threats of distributed denial of service (, DDoS ) for extortion"
181,uk.pdf,18,"Whilst OCGs may pose a significant threat to our collective prosperity and security, equally of concern is the continuing threat from acts of less sophisticated but widespread cyber crimes carried out against individuals or smaller organisations"
182,uk.pdf,18," Internet banking fraud, which covers fraudulent payments taken from a customers bank account using the internet"
183,uk.pdf,18, Banking channel rose by 64 % to 133
184,uk.pdf,18,", The number of cases increased at a lower rate of 23 %, which Financial Fraud Action UK said is evidence of the growing trend for criminals to target business and high net-worth customers"
185,uk.pdf,18,States and state-sponsored threats: 
186,uk.pdf,18,"We regularly see attempts by states and state-sponsored groups to penetrate UK networks for political, diplomatic, technological, commercial and strategic advantage with a principal focus on the government, defence, finance, energy and telecommunications sectors"
187,uk.pdf,18, The capacity and impact of 
188,uk.pdf,18,"These state cyber programmes, varies"
189,uk.pdf,18," The most advanced nations, continue to improve their capabilities at pace, integrating encryption and anonymisation services into their tools in order to remain covert"
190,uk.pdf,18," While they have the technical capability to deploy sophisticated attacks, they can often achieve their aims using basic tools and techniques against vulnerable targets, because the defences of their victims are poor"
191,uk.pdf,18,Only a handful of states have the technical capabilities to pose a serious threat to the UKs overall security and prosperity
192,uk.pdf,18,", But many other states are developing sophisticated cyber programmes that could pose a threat to UK interests in the near future"
193,uk.pdf,18, Many states seeking to develop cyber espionage capability can purchase computer network exploitation tools off the shelf and repurpose these to conduct espionage
194,uk.pdf,18,"Beyond the espionage threat, a small number of hostile foreign threat actors have developed and deployed offensive cyber capabilities, including destructive ones"
195,uk.pdf,18," These capabilities threaten the security of the UKs, critical national infrastructure and industrial control"
196,uk.pdf,18," Some states may use these capabilities in contravention of international law in the belief that they can do so with relative impunity, encouraging others to follow suit"
197,uk.pdf,18, Whilst destructive attacks around the world remain rare
198,uk.pdf,19," They are rising in number and impact National Cyber Security Strategy, 2016Section 3 STRATEGIC CONTEXT"
199,uk.pdf,19,"Terrorist groups continue to aspire to conduct, damaging cyber activity against the UK and its interests"
200,uk.pdf,19, The current technical capability of terrorists is judged to be low
201,uk.pdf,19," Nonetheless, the impact of even low-capability activity against the UK to date has been disproportionately high, simple defacements and doxing activity (, where hacked personal details are leaked online ) enable terrorist groups and their supporters to attract media attention and intimidate their victims"
202,uk.pdf,19, Terrorists using the Internet for their purposes does not equal cyber terrorism
203,uk.pdf,19,", However, by increasingly engaging in cyber-space and given the availability of cyber-crime as a service, one can assume that they would be in the position to launch cyber attacks"
204,uk.pdf,19," Enisa Threat Landscape 2015, "
205,uk.pdf,19,"The current assessment is that physical, rather than cyber terrorist attacks, will remain the priority for terrorist groups for the immediate future"
206,uk.pdf,19," As an increasingly computer-literate generation engages in extremism, potentially exchanging enhanced technical skills, we envisage a greater volume of low-sophistication, (, defacement or DDoS ) disruptive activity against the UK"
207,uk.pdf,19," The potential for a number of skilled extremist lone actors to emerge will also increase, as will the risk that a terrorist organisation will seek to enlist an established insider"
208,uk.pdf,19, Terrorists will likely use any cyber capability to achieve the maximum effect possible
209,uk.pdf,19," Thus, even a moderate increase in terrorist capability may constitute a significant threat to the UK and its interests"
210,uk.pdf,19,Hacktivist groups are decentralised and issue-orientated
211,uk.pdf,19,"; They form and select their targets in response to perceived grievances, introducing a vigilante quality to many of their acts"
212,uk.pdf,19," While the majority of hacktivist cyber activity is disruptive in nature, ( website, defacement or DDoS ), more able hacktivists have been able to inflict greater and lasting damage on their victims"
213,uk.pdf,19,Insider threats remain a cyber risk to organisations in the UK
214,uk.pdf,19,", Malicious insiders who are trusted"
215,uk.pdf,19, Employees of an organisation and have access to critical systems and data pose the greatest threat
216,uk.pdf,19, They can cause financial and reputational damage through the theft of sensitive data and intellectual property
217,uk.pdf,19," They can also pose a destructive cyber threat if they use their privileged knowledge or access to facilitate or launch an attack to disrupt or degrade critical services on the network of their organisations or wipe data from the network Of equal concern are those insiders or employees who Accidentally cause cyber harm through inadvertent clicking on a phishing email, plugging an infected USB into a computer or ignoring security procedures and downloading unsafe content from the Internet"
218,uk.pdf,19," Whilst they have no intention of deliberately harming the organisation, their privileged access to systems and data mean their actions can cause just as much damage as a malicious insider"
219,uk.pdf,19, These individuals are often the victims of social engineering
220,uk.pdf,19, They can unwittingly provide access to the networks of their organisation or carry out instructions in good faith that benefit the fraudster National Cyber Security Strategy
221,uk.pdf,20,"20, The overall cyber risk to an organisation from insider threats is not just about unauthorised access to information systems and their content"
222,uk.pdf,20, The physical security controls protecting those systems from inappropriate access or removal of sensitive data or proprietary information on different forms of media are equally important
223,uk.pdf,20," Similarly, a robust personnel security culture that is alive to the threat posed by disaffected employees, fraud in the workforce and industrial and other forms of espionage is an important element in a comprehensive approach to security Script"
224,uk.pdf,20,"So-Called script, kiddies generally less skilled individuals who use scripts or programmes developed by others to conduct cyber attacks are not assessed as posing a substantive threat to the wider economy or society"
225,uk.pdf,20,", But they do have access to hacking, guides resources and tools on the Internet"
226,uk.pdf,20," Due to the vulnerabilities found in internet-facing systems used by many organisations, the actions of script kiddies can, in some cases, have a disproportionately damaging impact on an affected organisation CASE STUDY 1 TALKTALK COMPROMISE"
227,uk.pdf,20,"On 21 October 2015, UK telecommunications provider TalkTalk reported a successful cyber attack and a possible breach of customer data"
228,uk.pdf,20," Subsequent investigation determined that a database containing customer details had been accessed via public- facing internet servers, with the records of approximately 157,000 customers at risk, including names addresses and bank account details"
229,uk.pdf,20," On the same day, several TalkTalk employees received an email with a ransom demand for payment"
230,uk.pdf,20,", The attackers detailed the structure of the database as apparent proof that it had been accessed TalkTalks report of the breach, helped the police, supported by specialists at the National Crime Agency, to arrest the main suspects all based in the UK in October and November 2015"
231,uk.pdf,20," The attack demonstrates that even within large cyber-aware organisations, vulnerabilities can persist"

248,uk.pdf,21, The forensic investigation launched by Bangladesh Bank discovered that malware had been installed on the banks systems and had been used to gather intelligence on the procedures used by the bank for international payments and fund transfers
249,uk.pdf,21, Further analysis by BAE Systems of the malware linked to the attack uncovered sophisticated functionality for interacting with the local SWIFT Alliance Access software running in the Bangladesh Bank

253,uk.pdf,21, Use of the BlackEnergy3 malware has been blamed by some for the attack after samples were identified on the network
254,uk.pdf,21, At least six months before the attack attackers had sent phishing emails to the offices of power utility companies in the Ukraine containing malicious Microsoft Office documents
255,uk.pdf,21," However, the malware was not likely to have been responsible for opening the circuit breakers, which resulted in the outage"
256,uk.pdf,21," It is probable that the malware enabled the attackers to gather credentials that allowed them to gain direct remote control of aspects of the network, which would subsequently enable them to trigger the outage"
