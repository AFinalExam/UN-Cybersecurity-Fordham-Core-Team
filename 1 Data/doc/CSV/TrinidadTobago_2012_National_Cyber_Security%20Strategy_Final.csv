179,TrinidadTobago_2012_National_Cyber_Security%20Strategy_Final.pdf,18, The initial focus will be on the elaboration of guidelines and the creation of programmes in cyber safety for primary and secondary school students
180,TrinidadTobago_2012_National_Cyber_Security%20Strategy_Final.pdf,18, Higher education institutions will also be encouraged to adopt policies and measures necessary to improve system
181,TrinidadTobago_2012_National_Cyber_Security%20Strategy_Final.pdf,18, Scientific research and innovation are also critical to ensuring cyber security and development of the national digital economy
182,TrinidadTobago_2012_National_Cyber_Security%20Strategy_Final.pdf,18," Thus, training and ongoing research to develop innovative security tools will be conducted in order to maintain reliable systems while building resistance to current and future threats"
183,TrinidadTobago_2012_National_Cyber_Security%20Strategy_Final.pdf,18, The GoRTT will allocate resources for training and education of individuals who can develop such tools and specialise in securing critical information
