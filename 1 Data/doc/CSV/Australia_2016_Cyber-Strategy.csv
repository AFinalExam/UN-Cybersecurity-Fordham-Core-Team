258,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,17, The term ‘cyber espionage’ refers to theft of information for intelligence
259,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,17, ‘Cybercrime’ refers to crimes directed at computers such as illegally modifying electronic data or seeking a ransom to unlock a computer affected by malicious software
260,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,17, It also includes crimes where computers are part of an offence such as online fraud
261,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,17," This Strategy, the term ‘cyber attack’, refers to deliberate acts that seriously compromise national security, stability or prosperity by manipulating denying access to degrading or destroying computers or networks or the information resident on them"
262,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,17, Other serious compromises are simply referred to as ‘malicious cyber activity’
263,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,18,Cyber adversaries are aggressive and persistent in their efforts to compromise Australian networks and information
264,Australia_2016_Cyber-Strategy.pdf,18, They are constantly improving their tradecraft in an attempt to defeat our network defences and exploit new technologies
