112,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12,", For example, local operating conditions and other national regulations and practices may differ from Norwegian ICT, security requirements or regulations for privacy and personal information"
113,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12," The lack of transparancy also makes it difficult for Norwegian authorities to carry out inspections and control activities, Internet and mobile devices"
114,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12," The increased use of the Internet and new computer systems, industrial control systems, mobile phones, memory, sticks, social media and tablets has made us more efficient, but Also more vulnerable Downtime is increasingly critical"
115,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12," Society has become more vulnerable to even short, interruptions to systems and networks, increasing the importance of having a secure and robust ICT infrastructure, New service platforms and lack of clarity"
116,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12, The increased use of new types of service platforms such as online and cloud computing means less transparent solutions and can make it more difficult for users to assess risk and vulnerability and document their own security
117,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12, Increased use of offshoring
118,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12, Norwegian companies are increasingly outsourcing operational and systems development tasks to suppliers located in other countries and on other continents resulting in a A market for crime
119,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12, The Internet and mobile devices have led to a greater risk of being exposed to cyber crime

126,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12,", We must assume that sophisticated sabotage and attacks will be directed against critical information resources, including the computer systems that control industrial processes and critical infrastructure"
127,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,12, Major requirements for awareness and competence
128,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,14,New services and devices place great demands on the competence of ordinary users
129,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,14, It is difficult for owners of critical infrastructure to have sufficient awareness and knowledge of vulnerabilities interdependencies between infrastructure components and what individual businesses must do to protect their infrastructure
130,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,14, Most companies currently have a system portfolio that is far more complex than just a few years

181,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,D Overarching Goals and 
182,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,"This strategy mainly addresses the challenges that we, as a society, must work together to solve"
183,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,", Based on the security challenges and trends discussed in Chapter 2 of this strategy, the Government has identified four overarching goals for information security, 1, Better coordination and common situational understanding"
184,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,"2, Robust and secure ICT infrastructure for everyone, 3 Good ability to handle adverse ICT events, 4 High level of competence and security awareness"
185,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, None of these overarching information security goals is more important than another and are mutually dependent success factors
186,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, These overarching goals will be operationalised through seven strategic priorities Ensure a more comprehensive and systematic approach to information security
187,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,Improve ICT infrastructure Ensure a common approach to information security in public administration
188,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,"Safeguard societys ability to detect, alert and handle serious ICT incidents"
189,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,"Safeguard societys ability to prevent, detect and investigate cyber crime"
190,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,Continuous efforts to raise awareness and competence 
191,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,"High quality, national research and development in the field of information security, "
192,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,This strategy also contains a brief status report and indicates specific areas that should be emphasised in the future
193,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, Processes for further clarification of strategic priorities and the implementation of specific measures are described in chapter 5 of this strategy
194,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, How the Government will follow up this strategy through specific measures will be described in an action plan which will be published separately and revised as necessary
195,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17," A More Comprehensive and Systematic Approach to Information, Security, Private and public organisations shall safeguard information, security comprehensively and systematically"
196,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17," This entails a conscious use of information security management systems, ( ISMS ) as a part of corporate governance, Recognised standards must be applied"
197,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, Requirements must be tailored to the risk facing the individual organisation
198,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17," The nature, size and social significance of the organisation will dictate its level of ambition and allocation of resources to security efforts"
199,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17," Several regulations require organisations to have an information security management system, e"
200,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, Electronic Public Administration Regulations which apply to the entire public sector
201,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, Regulations relating to the Personal Data Act apply to both the private and public sector
202,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17," In addition, the Security Act applies to the entire public sector and parts of the private sector"
203,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, Several regulations state that security efforts must be tailored to the risk
204,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17," Thus, it is crucial that public administration conduct good risk and vulnerability"
205,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17,", The Data Protection Authority, National Security Authority and Office of the Auditor General have revealed weaknesses in risk assessments conducted by public administration"
206,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, They point out that existing security measures are often unsystematic fragmented and that information security efforts neither have enough support from management
207,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, Nor are they well integrated into business management
208,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,17, An increased use of international security standards in public administration could contribute to more comprehensive and systematic security efforts
209,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18,Increased use of certified ICT products and systems may also help boost confidence in and improve the security of public sector systems and services in Norway
210,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, The following must be an area of focus
211,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, All departments and state-owned companies must have an information security management system
212,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18," This management system must be based on recognised security, standards"
213,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18," The systems, scope and level of detail must be tailored to the scope and nature of each organisation and the risk it faces"
214,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Local governments and private companies should be encouraged to establish similar management systems
215,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Improving ICT Infrastructure 
216,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18,"Ict infrastructure that supports critical societal functions must be robust and reliable, so that adverse events and actions are avoided to the greatest extent possible"
217,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, The power grid and electronic communications networks need particular attention
218,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, One primary objective is to require all stakeholders in the public and private sector to adhere to clear requirements and provide them with appropriate advice and guidance to enable them to procure and administrate electronic communications services with an adequate level of security
219,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18," Based on the risk facing the individual organisation, The same requirements should apply to owners of businesses with important societal functions"
220,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Technological developments entail that ICT infrastructure is constantly changing
221,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Parts of it will be renewed continuously
222,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, The traditional telephone network for voice communications is being replaced by electronic communications networks used for all kinds of services
223,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, It is therefore difficult to label certain parts of ICT infrastructure as critical and other parts as less critical for national security
224,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, It is important to emphasise that there are many electronic communications
225,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Users who are dependent on electronic communication must be able to use alternative communication solutions
226,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Users must have sufficient expertise to choose appropriate solutions and ensure that they receive the level of quality and reliability that they require from their service providers
227,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18,", This means that organisations need to have good user guidelines To ensure increased redundancy and a more robust infrastructure"
228,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Security must be weighed against environmental and economic considerations when planning and developing infrastructure
229,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18," Environmental and economic considerations are often important when establishing an infrastructure, for example, several companies using the same route for installing cables, many companies sharing a communications mast and the co-location of technical equipment"
230,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Experience shows that this can be at the expense of security
231,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18," On the other hand, security measures for one type of infrastructure can help safeguard other infrastructure along the same route"
232,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18," For example, securing a road against landslides can also help protect cables that run along the same route"
233,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, The implementation of changes to the the Security Acts asset security regulations is an important tool for identifying critical societal functions and revealing mutual dependencies
234,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, This will strengthen national ICT and societal security
235,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Selected areas of focus include Sectoral authorities must set requirements for the operational continuity of systems that are crucial for society
236,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Security measures for physical infrastructure must be coordinated across sectors so that different measures work together and do not conflict with each other
237,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, There should be regular drills for situations where infrastructure has partially reduced capacity or drops out
238,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,18, Sectoral ministries must verify that the sectors organisations identify and propose ICT functions and systems that can be classified as critical societal functions in line with asset security regulations
239,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20,"3, A Common Approach to Information Security in Public Administration, Digital communication should be the norm for communication with and within public administration"
240,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Our citizens, industry and public administration must be confident that electronic services in the public sector, as well as sectoral systems and online services, are secure and reliable"
241,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Therefore, we must establish comprehensive national solutions for secure communication and access to services"
242,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, These kinds of national solutions include ID-porten and government issued electronic IDs ( eID ) at a high level
243,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," In addition to security benefits, a centralised approach will also entail financial savings in the form of more unified development and operation of these systems"
244,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," The public authorities must clarify which general legal, organisational and technical security requirements apply to ministries and their subordinate organisations, key infrastructure owners and owners of classified ICT systems for use in public administration"
245,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, A common approach to information security will also put more pressure on arriving at a common way to express risk potential harm and security level for public administration Risk and vulnerability
246,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, Analyses should form the basis for all implementation of ICT security in public administration
247,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," There are many regulations for information, security and various departments have regulatory responsibilities"
248,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Currently, there is not one set of common minimum standards for the public sector with regard to security procedures and technical measures for individual organisations or for owners of critical infrastructure"
249,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, This may contribute to business systems not being compatible or that organisations do not have confidence in each others
250,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, Security levels such that they cannot communicate and share information securely
251,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Since there is such a large number of networks serving the public sector, it is difficult to establish secure, comprehensive solutions for the flow of information between ministries and between ministries and directorates"
252,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," In addition, such fragmented solutions do not facilitate a satisfactory level of security, Ministries and directorates"
253,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Need to communicate highly classified information with each other, both in daily work and in various crisis"
254,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, Practical experience has revealed challenges related to the ability of ministries to both administrate and communicate
255,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Evaluations of various drills also indicate that there is a lack of joint systems in public administration for communicating sensitive, confidential and classified information"
256,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, Several ministries and their departments have called for a common set of requirements for public sector security
257,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," There have been attempts to coordinate regulations, but they have proven difficult"
258,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Regulation, administrators and other regulatory bodies, such as the Agency for Public Management and eGovernment"
259,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," ( Difi ) has done much work in this area, but the efforts have not been sufficiently coordinated"
260,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," There is also a need to secure electronic communication between government agencies on the one hand, and citizens and businesses, on the other hand, Selected areas of focus include"
261,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Public authorities must clarify the general legal, organisational and technical security requirements that apply to ministries and their departments"
262,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, Key infrastructure owners and owners of classified ICT systems in the public sector
263,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, These requirements must be the basis of all exchange of information in public administration
264,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, They should also include general requirements for suppliers of ICT products and systems to the public sector
265,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Public organisations should be able to securely send and receive documents electronically, such that the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity can be guaranteed"
266,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, The need for specific systems and solutions to secure existing and new sectoral systems in public administration must be reduced to a minimum
267,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20," Ministries must have ICT solutions that make it possible to store, manage and communicate sensitive and classified electronic information across ministries"
268,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,20, These solutions must be compatible with corresponding systems in the defence sector
269,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21,"4 Safeguard Societys Ability to Detect, Alert and Handle Serious ICT Incidents"
270,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," Norway must be in a constant state of proactive, operational preparedness in order to prevent, detect and coordinate reactions to serious ICT incidents"
271,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," In this context, relevant authorities and organisations must work in close collaboration, with special emphasis on working with those parts of the private sector that own or operate infrastructure"
272,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," This collaboration must address both intentional and unintentional events, such as technical or human error, accidents or natural disasters"
273,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," In this context, serious ICT incidents include targeted attacks against critical ICT infrastructure and sensitive confidential and classified information"
274,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, The large volume of minor incidents can also have serious consequences
275,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, ( such as leaks of sensitive business information or loss of confidential or sensitive information )
276,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," Currently, not all organisations know what to do if they have a major ICT incident or do not have the necessary routines and detection mechanisms in place to prevent, detect, alert and manage ICT incidents"
277,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, There is great variation in terms of what incidents are recorded and reported to national authorities
278,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," In many cases, measures that make ICT systems more robust and reduce the impact of incidents, regardless of the cause, will be common for all organisations"
279,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, It would be economically beneficial if such measures were coordinated
280,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, Organisations that are subject to the Security Act are required to report to the National Security Authority if they detect incidents that threaten security
281,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, But this is not enough to get a comprehensive overview of the situation in close contact with NorCERT and businesses in their sector or are in the process of doing so
282,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," (, for example, the defence, health and welfare and justice sectors"
283,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," ), Their sectoral expertise improves our overall ability to handle incidents and also ensures that the responsibility of sectoral authorities is safeguarded"
284,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, More and more individual organisations are establishing internal response teams or outsourcing such services
285,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," NorCERT is jointly financed by public and private funds For incidents affecting electronic communications, such as software errors, loss or interruption of Internet services, mobile phone services or other electronic communication services"
286,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, There are routines in place for network providers to notify the Post and Telecommunications Authority Selected areas of focus include
287,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," There must be ICT alert teams with the basic capacity to coordinate and manage ICT incidents for all sectors, ( such as a sectoral CSIRT ), and for the most important organisations that support critical societal functions"
288,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, These alert teams should be structured such that they take into consideration
289,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," The use architecture and governance of ICT infrastructure in the sector, The national CERT function, ( NorCERT ), must actively collect and analyse information related to serious ICT"
290,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, NorCERT shall have the national responsibility for coordinating the management of such incidents and provide relevant and timely information and guidance to sectoral response teams and response teams in organisations that manage ICT infrastructure that is critical or important for societal functions
291,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," The Norwegian Computer Emergency Response Team, ( NorCERT ) in the National Security Authority, with the help of the Early Warning System for Digital Infrastructure, (, VDI, ) and a national collaboration have the ability to prevent, detect and analyse data related to serious incidents on the Internet"
292,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, Norcert works closely with other countries and similar services in international organisations
293,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, Norcert also participates in a Nordic CERT collaboration
294,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, Some key sectors of society have established sectoral response teams
295,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21, Cooperation with the private sector must be expanded and improved
296,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,21," NorCERT must analyse and communicate relevant risk information in an appropriate and responsible manner to those who are responsible for taking action, whether it be companies, sectoral authorities, the police, other public authorities or at the political level Preparedness For dealing with malicious incidents, ( crime, espionage, sabotage and terrorism, ) "
297,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22,"Should be coordinated at all levels with adequate preparedness for handling random events caused by failures, accidents, the weather and natural disasters, Notification and management procedures for faults, failures and loss of electronic communication must be improved"
298,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, The Post and Telecommunications Authority and NorCERT must establish procedures for the prompt and effective exchange of information about adverse events
299,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, Companies and sectors must plan and conduct drills designed to improve their ability to manage incidents
300,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Furthermore, collaboration across sectors and international boundaries must also be drilled"
301,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Safeguard societys ability to prevent, detect and investigate cyber crime"
302,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, Cyber criminals should not be able to plan or execute crimes without a significant risk of being detected and prosecuted
303,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Societys ability to prevent, detect and investigate cyber crime must be prioritised"
304,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," All stakeholders should, on their own initiative, implement crime prevention measures in their own organisations and seek to minimise losses or damage as a result of cyber crime"
305,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, Public authorities shall achieve this through increased expertise and improving specialist expertise and the skills of police generalists
306,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," The police must make this a priority and increase their capacity to give them a greater ability to prevent, detect and investigate cyber crime"
307,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, Public authorities will continue to increase their capacity in this field in order to detect cyber crime that directly or indirectly may have an impact on national security or vital national interests
308,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Cyber crime includes crime aimed at computer systems and networks and crime, in which key elements of the chain of events are committed using computers or computer networks"
309,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, There is no clear division between the two
310,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, Hackers often have a goal of gaining access to information that could be used to commit traditional crimes at a later time
311,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," In recent years, cyber crime has evolved from troublesome pranks to serious organised crime"
312,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, Criminals are also increasingly using new technology to commit traditional crimes
313,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Some crimes may have consequences that may require infrastructure providers, sectoral authorities or companies themselves to implement crisis management"
314,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, with assistance from NorCERT or sectoral CSIRT )
315,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, There is a need for information retrieval over the Internet and securing electronic leads during a crisis
316,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22, The police must also investigate what ( and who ) caused the criminal offense that triggered the crisis
317,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Criminals purchase tools for conducting various crimes over the Internet, such as software that can take control of other computers"
318,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Threat assessments, and experience indicate that organised crime in particular employs the most modern computer tools to hide their activity from the police and impede investigations"
319,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Point to an expected increase in cyber crime as a result of technological developments in general and the increase in mobile devices such as mobile phones and computers in particular, Police, are largely dependent on tips or complaints from the public to detect cyber crime"
320,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," It is a challenge that for certain types of cyber crime, there is a gap between public perception of what is right and wrong, and the relevant regulations"
321,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Copyright infringement and peer- to-peer file sharing is one example of this challenge: The Norwegian Business Security Councils, cyber crime survey For 2012 indicates that the gap between threats and security measures taken by both public and private organisations is increasing"
322,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," At the same time, there is an increase in their dependency on ICT"
323,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," Norwegian companies, especially at the executive level, lack knowledge about information security and do not have an overview of threats and incidents"
324,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," In many cases, companies will not be aware that their server/network identity has been compromised"
325,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,22," In addition, companies experience that the police dont have the capacity to prioritise cyber crime other than in very serious cases"
326,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23,"Prevention detection, investigation and legal prosecution of cyber crime is challenging"
327,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23, This work is often time consuming and requires specialised expertise and tools
328,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," In addition, there are often considerable challenges in identifying the criminal/ source"
329,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," There are currently few police units with the necessary expertise for this type of investigation in Norway, as evidenced by the relatively low number of convictions related to cyber crime"
330,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," The danger is that applicable legislation could lose its general and individual preventive effect, since the chances of being convicted are perceived as small Selected areas of focus include"
331,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," All stakeholders must take initiative to help prevent and mitigate losses or damage, resulting from cyber crime and identity theft and abuse"
332,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," The police must have sufficient expertise and capacity to detect, identify and deal with"
333,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Police must be present on the Internet, both openly and covertly in order to prevent, avert and when necessary, investigate and try to bring this type of crime to justice"
334,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," There must be clear procedures for collaboration and sharing knowledge both within the police and between the police, government agencies and key security environments"
335,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Continuous Efforts to Raise Awareness and Competence, Our citizens, staff and executives in Norwegian companies must be security conscious and increase their information security skills"
336,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Everyone should have access to information about security, challenges and countermeasures"
337,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23, Everyone should understand that measures must be taken
338,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Companies must have the necessary procurement expertise for purchasing new ICT tools and services, employing external consultants or outsourcing services"
339,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Cios must have adequate knowledge of ICT security, vulnerabilities and the need for redundancy in conjunction with the acquisition and operation of ICT systems"
340,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23, All children and young people should have basic information security skills
341,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23, Security incidents happen daily
342,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," In some cases, they have significant consequences for individuals or for society as a whole"
343,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Established activities organised by the Centre for Information, Security, (, NorSIS, ), the Business Security Council, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, the Post and Telecommunications Authority and the Media Authority"
344,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23, An increasing need for awareness and education
345,Norway_2012_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Norway.pdf,23," Data can be lost, abused and manipulated without it being the result of a deliberate attack"
