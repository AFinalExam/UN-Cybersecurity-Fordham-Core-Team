21,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4," On the other hand, however, the increasing dependency of the public and private sectors on these technologies, if insuf ciently protected, renders them more vulnerable, making cyber security"
22,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4, One of the most important challenges the state has to face: today
23,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4, Globalism and the signi cance of impacts of potential cyber attacks have resulted in the need for a conceptual and coordinated control of protection and defence of cyber space
24,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4," By adopting this Concept, the Slovak Republic has established its visions and priorities providing for cyber security in the country"
25,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4," The Concept has to be seen as the cornerstone, the basic and starting document for the subsequent formulation of legislation, standards, methodology rules, security policies and other tools necessary for ensuring the protection and defence of national cyber space"

30,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4, Cyber security ought to be perceived as one of the key components of national security
31,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4," It is a complex eld, involving both legal and technical aspects and required trust and collaboration of the public sector, private sector and academic institutions"

39,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,4,Of the Slovak Republic 
40,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5,The exponential growth in the use of information and communication technologies from the second half of the 20th century onwards has signi cantly in uenced development trends in society
41,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5, Modern information and communication technologies have substantially broadened the possibilities and increased the ef ciency of the interaction methods between geographically remote entities from various elds of the society and economy
42,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5," The growing number of users of information and communication technologies results in an increasing dependency of both the public and the private sectors on these technologies, rendering them more vulnerable"
43,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5," Besides the high dependency of society on information and communication technologies, the beginning of the 21st century was marked by a signi cant change in the global security environment and an increasing number of asymmetrical threats with a higher degree of sophistication and impact effects"
44,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5," A wide scope of potential methods of abuse and damage to electronic information, communication and control systems, as well as of a negative in uencing of social and economic processes in the framework of the international cyber environment, thus included cyber threats among potentially serious global threats such as International terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, etc, Critical control, technological communication and security systems are endangered by new forms of attacks, and so are those services that would, if failing or malfunctioning, seriously impact the operation of the state (, mostly in its main security areas"
45,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5, ) Dynamically developing modern technologies make it possible for additional new security threats to emerge
46,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5, The Slovak Republic must be prepared to react to a wide spectre of existing and potential threats
47,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5," At the same time, it is aware of the fact that threats and attacks emerging in cyber space may escalate up to a level that would require collaboration of the allies within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization"
48,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5, ( hereinafter referred to as NATO ) under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty1
49,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5, That would result in a collective defence and/or coordinated response
50,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5," Thus, cyber security also needs to be perceived as a subsystem of national security and cyber space as its new operational domain"
51,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5,", The Slovak Republic intends to cooperate with all relevant state and private cyber space actors, which respect identical values and do not restrict the freedom and safety Of the use of cyber space, This Cyber Security Concept of the Slovak Republic for the years 2015-2020, ( hereinafter, referred to as the Concept ) de nes, the starting position and the goals of the Slovak Republic in the eld of cyber security"
52,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,5," The Concept is harmonized with the Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic and forms a basic and starting document for the subsequent creation of regulations, standards, methodical instructions, rules, security policies and other instruments necessary to provide for cyber security"

55,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, The Concept is based on a statement and a description of the basic terms and principles
56,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6," Characteristics of the current situation of the strategic, legal and institutional frameworks in the area of cyber security in the Slovak Republic and on a strategic and methodological framework formed by NATO and European Union ( hereinafter referred to as the EU ) documents"
57,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6," Subsequently, the Concept formulates principles, goals and proposed solutions"
58,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, 1 Basic Terms: 
59,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6,Cyber security is one of the de ning elements of the security environment of the Slovak Republic and a subsystem of national security
60,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, At a state level
61,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6," It is a system of continuous and planned increasing of political, legal, economic security, defence and educational awareness, also including the ef ciency of adopted and applied risk control measures of a technical-organizational nature in cyber space, in order to transform it into a trustworthy environment"
62,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6," Providing for the secure operation of social and economic processes at an acceptable level of risks in cyber space, The Slovak Republic still lacks a consistent formalized terminology in the area of cyber security"
63,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6," The word cyber and its other grammatical forms do not occur in any generally binding regulation, nor in terminological dictionaries2 De nitions of the practically used terms in the cyber security area and de nitions of key terms"

68,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, A legally binding de nition of the meaning of these terms is of crucial importance5
69,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, The relation of cyber security to the basic security areas of operation of the state and the mutual relation between cyber security and information security are discussed in the following chapter of the Concept: 2 Basic Principles of Cyber Security
70,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, The eld of cyber security must not be seen as an isolated problem of the Slovak Republic or an isolated problem of one or several elements of society
71,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, Due to its global nature
72,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, Cyber security is a society-wide phenomenon
73,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6, Cyber security must be based on a complex approach requiring intense joint use of information and coordination of activities on both national and international levels
74,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,6," When building cyber security, it is necessary to pursue collaboration between the civilian and security units of the state, public and private sectors, as well as national and international institutions"

85,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,7," Failure to adhere to minimum security rules, protection methods and minimum security measures in the area of cyber security and the lack of uni cation thereof, increases the level of vulnerability of the operated, electronic information, communication and control systems"

87,SLOVAKIA_NCSS%20-2.pdf,7," Managing security incidents and events does not only depend on the capacities of the public sector, but it is also signi cantly dependent on the constructive cooperation of actors active outside the public sector, Cyber Security as a Component of the States, Security System, Insuf, cient protection and defence Against security incidents creates space for rendering society itself vulnerable, with consequences throughout all social and economic processes i"
