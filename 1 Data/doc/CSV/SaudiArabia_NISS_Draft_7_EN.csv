1263,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62," In order for any country to realize the goal of becoming an information-secure society, all components of the nation must work cooperatively toward a set of common goals"
1264,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62, Achieving this across the many sectors of the Kingdom will require new internal cooperation and coordination
1265,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62," Current information security efforts are uneven between different ministries across critical infrastructures, the private sector and among the people In discussions with many nations across the globe"
1266,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62, One of the essential requirements identified to achieve an effective national approach to information security was the need for close and focused internal coordination and communication
1267,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62, Experience has demonstrated that a country can develop more uniform policies and emergency response procedures when all facets of the government and private sectors work in a cooperative manner
1268,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62," This is especially true for information and cyber security, where standardization, coordination and agility are vital components of a world-class capability"
1269,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62, The approach to increase internal cooperation and information sharing is simple
1270,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62, The NISS focuses its recommendations on specific sectors and specific issues that should form the basis of improving national information sharing and coordination
1271,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62," Finally, this section proposes the creation of a program that will both further enhance and test national information sharing initiatives, especially during crises"

1275,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62, One example where internal information sharing processes were effective is the case of Estonia
1276,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,62," One of the keys for success in combating the Estonian cyber-attacks during May 2007 was the continuous cooperation between the executive, civilian, national security and private sector communities within Estonia"

1301,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,63, National ICT Infrastructure identifies models that have succeeded elsewhere and recommends a national strategy be developed
1302,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,63," The NISS approach is to leverage the work already being done within some sectors, for example, energy and banking, and to extend the outreach to other critical sectors with more involvement from the regional governments"
1303,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,63," This will require new processes to encourage collaboration between regional governments and industries, to develop trust and a true partnership to minimize costs and to achieve the goal of a more secure national economy and infrastructure"
1304,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,63, The NISS recognizes that additional collaboration opportunities must be created between the government and private sectors at both the national and regional levels
1305,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,63," The national government should create information sharing mechanisms to collaborate with local industry, on security issues facing industry, collect specific threat, information detected by industry and provide national threat and policy guidance to industry"

1540,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,72, This could be done by adding noise to the host elements or by overlaying a known message
1541,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,72," Another valuable feature might be the development of a stenographic-defeating technique that would have a high probability of defeating steganography, but not affect legitimate watermarking"

1545,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73,Two areas are ripe for innovation and research
1546,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73, First is the question as to whether or not the KSA should invest in building a chip foundry within the Kingdom that is operated by and for the Kingdoms? Subjects
1547,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73, A foundry and training the skilled technicians to run it is a significant undertaking and expense
1548,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73, It is suggested that the question be answered with respect to the necessary scale and complexity of chips that are essential for secure functioning of absolutely critical infrastructure within the Kingdom
1549,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73,It is further suggested that a first foundry effort not be oriented to fabricating using the most advanced integrated Circuit technologies but integrated circuits that can be modularly combined to provide the critical functions
1550,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73," Such an effort will not result in the fastest, smallest or perhaps most efficient, integrated circuits, but the expectation of security may well offset any cosmetic or any performance diminishments incurred, Backup, Keying, Variable Distribution"

1553,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73, It presents us with the apparent ability of being able to communicate securely over an open channel without any a priori distribution of keying material
1554,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73, The usual method is to establish a common secret quantity between two or more correspondents and then use this common secret quantity to establish a commonly held and commonly used keying variable
1555,SaudiArabia_NISS_Draft_7_EN.pdf,73," Therefore, it seems prudent because of quantum computation for a modern, technologically advanced e-network, to consider a backup cryptography for securely conducting the nations business"
