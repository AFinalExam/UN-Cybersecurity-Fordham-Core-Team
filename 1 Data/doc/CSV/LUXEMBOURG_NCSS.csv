35,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,5," For this reason, the government is determined to review its strategy on a recurring basis, update its governance tools and ensure to remain sovereign"
36,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,5," With respect to certain critical services related to security, The government understands that information security is a societal challenge that needs to be addressed jointly by engaging in appropriate behaviours and implementing effective and efficient organisational and technical measures while complying with principles of proportionality and necessity"

46,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6, Luxembourg has many initiatives under way in the field of prevention
47,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6," These initiatives are coordinated by the Cyber Security Board, ( CSB ) and most of them are executed by public actors"
48,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6," In the preventive field, priority was given to organisational security measures"
49,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6, The government has identified risk analysis as a priority
50,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6," Indeed, it is only after such an analysis that an entity may identify the organisational and technical measures required"
51,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6, This analysis ensures that the measures put in place comply with the principle of proportionality and necessity
52,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6," As a result, CASES developed an optimised approach to risk analysis based on a common taxonomy, taking advantage of the sectoral knowledge bases and offering great synergistic potential"
53,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6," The MONARC optimised risk analysis methodology, The CTIE, GOVCERT and CIRCL conducted internal risk analyses An inventory of databases dealing with personal data under the responsibil- ity of the State has been compiled by the CSBs Database working group"
54,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6, The CSB instructed a Mobile devices working group to prepare a proposal to equip members of the government with secure mobile communication devices
55,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6, The findings were presented to the CSB With regards to risk treatment
56,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,6, Cases has developed several good practice guides that are made available to all the entities concerned

64,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,7, This plan is regularly tweaked during European cyber exercises in which Luxembourg participates
65,LUXEMBOURG_NCSS.pdf,7, PIU Cyber developed under the authority of HCPN sets out government action in the event of significant issues with information systems of the public or private sector
