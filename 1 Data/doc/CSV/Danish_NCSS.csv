52,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6,We must seize the digital opportunities
53,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, Denmark is in a good position to embrace the digital future
54,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, We are a small country with a population that has great trust and confidence in each other and in the public
55,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, People generally have a high level of education
56,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, People and businesses have good digital competences and have gener- ally embraced digital technologies
57,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6," There is a strong tradition of collaboration and find- ing, new and practical solutions between public authorities and across the public and private sectors"
58,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6," Furthermore, the public sector began in- troducing IT solutions early on, and for this reason in particular, it has high-quality data sets and registries which are quite unique in an international perspective"
59,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6," Denmark has built a secure and robust digital in- frastructure, which allows individuals and businesses to complete efficiently their business with the public sector over the internet"
60,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, All of this has enabled a huge digital transition in recent years
61,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, Significant digital developments in the public sector
62,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, The internet is today the primary gateway to public administration for the majority of Danes
63,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, Individuals and businesses have their own digital mailbox
64,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, Online self- service has been made mandatory for more than 100 administrative procedures
65,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6," When the Central Customs and Tax Administra- tion ( SKAT ) opens up For online access to tax assessments, digital Danes flood onto the website"
66,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6," Furthermore, digital solutions are an in- tegral part of many public services"

72,Danish_NCSS.pdf,6, The Danish welfare system builds on the public's widespread confidence and trust in the public sector

76,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," Digital safety and security of individuals and businesses are essential to being able to ex- ploit the opportunities offered by digitisation to develop and improve the Danish welfare system, and digitisation does offer huge op- portunities for individuals, as well as for so- ciety in general"
77,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," The Danish public sector is designed to ensure that services for citizens and busi- nesses are, as far as possible, organised at local or regional levels within the frame- work of the law"
78,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," This approach helps en- sure, a greater sense of security and public trust, as well as a greater degree of user centricity in services"
79,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," Therefore, digitisation must underpin local decision power and re- sponsibility"
80,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, When public services become digital
81,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, People should not feel that the public sector is becoming distant with no anchoring in the local community
82,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," Instead, digitisation should promote a continued feeling of local anchorage"
83,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," For example, digitisation can enhance the degree of user centricity and the empower- ment of individuals, because digital solutions allow them easy access from home or in their local area to services and information of high quality, regardless of where in Den- mark they live"
84,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, Digital services are becoming Increasingly more adaptable to the needs of the individual i
85,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, they are becoming ever more user-centric
86,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," Furthermore, with digi- tal welfare solutions, citizens can become'co-players' in delivery of their welfare ser- vices"
87,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, With more efficient digital solutions
88,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, It is possible to improve the quality of services and enable local development
89,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7, Denmark has a well-developed infrastruc- ture for mobile and broadband coverage
90,Danish_NCSS.pdf,7," However, if we are to continue to have a society that works efficiently and with local anchoring, we need to ensure that this good mobile and broadband coverage is improved"

94,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8,"ities can collaborate smoothly to provide good and efficient services to individuals or businesses, based on the knowledge that they already have about them"
95,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8," For this to become a reality, the authorities must, to a greater extent, be able to exchange and access relevant data on individuals in a secure manner, not least in situations in which many authorities are involved"
96,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8," Local, regional and central governments therefore have to work towards more shar- ing of data"

99,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8," Increased use of data can be supported by common data standards, standardised data formats common IT ar- chitectures and a robust IT infrastructure"
100,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8, Increased sharing of data will enable new generations of digital solutions which can automatically find the necessary data
101,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8," In-, dividuals and businesses will save time because they do not have to report data unnecessarily"
102,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8," Furthermore, administrative processes and case work will be eased if manual workflows and in some situations decisions can be automated More efficient sharing and exchange of data between various IT systems and organisa-"

104,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8," Individuals and businesses should, as far as possible, only have to submit infor- mation to the authorities once instead of having to enter the same information in seve- ral places in public digital solutions"
105,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8, Greater use and reuse of data will also im- prove the basis for the public services de- livered
106,Danish_NCSS.pdf,8, This will also contribute to a more modern and efficient public sector and thus release resources which can be applied to other political priorities

110,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9,", The goal is for Danish businesses to become better at exploiting new paths to growth"
111,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9," This requires that Denmark and Danish busi- nesses become better at exploiting the potential in, for example, automation and new technologies, and by doing so en- hance productivity and competitiveness"
112,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9, This applies in particular to the many Danish small and medium-sized enterprises
113,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9, Efforts by the public sector must promote digitisation in the private sector
114,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9," With more digitisation, businesses will become better at exploiting business potentials in a digital world"
115,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9, They will become more competitive and they will improve their productivity
116,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9, Creation of a strong digital Denmark with new opportunities and improved frame- work conditions for businesses calls for new public-private partnerships
117,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9," Data is an all-important resource in a digital era, a resource which opens up for new busi- ness opportunities and which can be used to optimise internal business procedures"
118,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9," It is important that, within the framework of the law, more public-sector data is made available to businesses so that this data can serve as a driver for innovation and new business opportunities in the private sector"
119,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9," This should provide the business community with good opportunities for finding combin-, ing and reusing data to develop new inno-, vative products and services, so that busi- nesses will be well positioned in the future competition Digitisation efforts should create strong framework conditions for businesses and support their digital Transition"
120,Danish_NCSS.pdf,9,", For example, better and more user-friendly digital solu-, tions and automated data collection from businesses should contribute to the goal of reducing significantly the administrative burden on businesses"
121,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10,A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK
122,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10,"Denmark on the way, Although Denmark has already become far more digital, we have only just embarked on the very extensive process of transition With digital solutions becoming ever more widespread"
123,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, Citizens and businesses have high expectations for digital public services that are up-to-date and add value to every- day life
124,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10," However, technological developments are happening at such a pace that we are not always able to predict the digital opportuni- ties, users' needs and societal benefits that the future will bring"
125,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10," When development of the eIdentification solution, NemID was planned in 2008"
126,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, Smartphones were not that widespread and the computer tablet had yet to be invented
127,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10," Therefore, it could not have been predicted that only a few years later, users would want to be able to read their digital post or log onto public-service web portals and onto self-service or online bank- ing solutions from their mobile devices"
128,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10," Continuous modernisation, necessary Continuous improvement and adaptation of public sector, digital solutions and systems are therefore necessary in step with the development of technologies and of soci- ety"
129,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, This will require investment
130,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, It will also be necessary for a num- ber of authorities to modernise or replace some of their IT systems either because they are outdated or because they are no longer working according to their intended purpose
131,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10," Furthermore, the IT solutions and process- es of a number of authorities are today designed to match the internal needs and organisation of the authority, rather than the needs of citizens and businesses, which in many cases, go across authorities and sec-"
132,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, Tors Much data is still stored differently and de- fined differently from one public authority to another
133,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, This makes exchange of data across sectors or administrations very dif- ficult
134,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10, This in turn makes it unnecessarily complicated for different authorities to col- laborate to deliver the best and most effi- cient services to individuals and businesses
135,Danish_NCSS.pdf,10," This calls for solutions, Therefore, extensive development and clear-up work is required so that citizens and businesses can rest assured the ser- vice"

140,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11,Expenditures and revenues will come under pressure
141,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11, The public sector will be faced with a signifi- cant strain on public expenditure in the years to come
142,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11," This is due, in particular to demands to deal with an aging population, climate change, housing and integrating refugees, as well as more expenditure on the health services"

144,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11, Legislation as well as language and accessi- bility requirements will be significant for our opportunities to develop Danish public services and administrations
145,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11, Financing the Danish welfare system is based on the taxes and charges paid by individuals and businesses
146,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11," However, digital development and new business models will also challenge the revenue models and regulatory models of the public sector"
147,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11," The global digital economy is expected to grow and in the long term, per- haps require new solutions"
148,Danish_NCSS.pdf,11, New internet-based business models can pro- vide new opportunities for growth

157,Danish_NCSS.pdf,12," In parallel with joint public sector efforts, there are sector-specific digitisation projects and strategies, for example joint municipal and regional digital strategies"
158,Danish_NCSS.pdf,12, This approach to public sector digitisation efforts provides a good balance between common strategic targets and local adaptation and priorities

160,Danish_NCSS.pdf,12," Since 2001, digitisation of the public sector has been driven by close and binding collab- oration between local, regional and central governments"
161,Danish_NCSS.pdf,12, This is applies especially in areas in which it is necessary and appro- priate to develop cross-cutting solutions

403,Danish_NCSS.pdf,28, It means that patients do not have to serve as liaison and be responsible for the knowledge transfer between various health staff
404,Danish_NCSS.pdf,28, This will provide security and improve patient treatment
