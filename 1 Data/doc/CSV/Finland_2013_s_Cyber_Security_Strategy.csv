239,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19, The key purpose of this document is to increase the understanding of cyber se- curity actors of the cyber domain and consequently help them improve their cyber se- curity
240,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," The background dossier expands the Strategy and explains in further detail the national cyber security approach, the cyber domain and the threat scenario that deter- mines our preparedness"

247,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19, When IT equipment and systems are down the ICT infrastructure crashes or seri- ous cyber attacks occur
248,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," These can result in extremely negative impacts on public servic- es business, life and administration and consequently, the viability of society as a whole"
249,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," Cyber attacks can seriously disrupt or even paralyse segments of critical infrastruc-, ture and societys vital functions"
250,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19, The state or an organisation can be forced to make po- litical military or financial concessions
251,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," The great powers equate cyber attacks with mili- tary action, which can be met with any available means"
252,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," Thus far, cyber operations have been interpreted as soft measures, for which reason the threshold for using them is estimated to be below that of traditional military oper- ations"
253,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19, The increasing cyber activism cybercrime and cyber espionage denote growing activity among states and non-state actors
254,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," Consequently, the cyber domain has trans- formed the traditional power structure, providing even small states and non-state actors with an opportunity to have effectual action"
255,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19, It is no longer size and mass that matter
256,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,19," Rather, it is expertise"

598,Finland_2013_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf,36, An attack can also mean one executed by non-state actors if it is so organised and wide-ranging that it can be likened to an attack carried out by a state
