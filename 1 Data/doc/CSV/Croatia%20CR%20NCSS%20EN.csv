12,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,2,Implementation OF THE STRATEGY - 
13,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,2,Appendix TERMS AND ACRONYMS 
14,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3,Nowhere has technological development been more dynamic and comprehensive than in the area of communication and information technology
15,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," The focus has always been on the rapid development and introduction of new services and products, while the security-related aspects usually had little influence on the broad acceptance of new technologies"
16,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," The life cycles of modern-day information systems from the process of planning, introduction and usage to their withdrawal from use are very short, which often makes their systematic testing impossible and is most commonly applied as an exception"
17,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," In expressly prescribed cases, Users usually have minimal knowledge of the technology they are using and the technology is applied in such a way"
18,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," That makes it very hard to estimate the security characteristics of the majority of commercial products regarding the protection of user data, confidentiality and privacy"
19,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," Due to that users, attitude towards the communication and information technology is based almost exclusively on blind confidence"
20,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3, Modern societies are deeply imbued with communication and information
21,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," People are nowadays connected using various technologies for the transmission of text image and sound, including the increasing Internet of Things"
22,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," ( IoT ) trend, While a deviation in the normal functioning of a certain kind of communication and information system could go unnoticed"
23,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3, Improper operation of some other systems could have harsh consequences for the functioning of the State
24,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," It can cause loss of life, damage to health, great material damage, pollution of the environment and the disturbance of other functionalities essential for the proper functioning of the society as a whole"
25,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," From the beginning of the development of communication and information technologies, until the present day, deviations in their proper functioning have occurred due to different reasons from human error or malicious action to technological error or organizational omission"
26,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," The creation of the Internet and connecting a number of communication and information systems of the public, academic and economic sectors, as well as citizens, created the contemporary cyberspace composed not only of this interconnected infrastructure, but also of the ever growing amounts of available information and users"
27,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," Communicating increasingly among themselves using a growing number of different services, some completely new, some traditional, but in a new virtual form"
28,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3, Deviations in the proper operation of these interconnected systems or their parts are no longer merely technical difficulties
29,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3, They pose a danger with a global security
30,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3, Modern societies counter them with a range of activities and measures collectively called cyber security
31,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3, The term cyber entered the Croatian legal system upon the ratification of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime1 back in 2002
32,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," Following from that, the term cyber is most 1 Act on the Ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime, ( Official Gazette No 09/02 ) and Act on the Ratification of the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime"
33,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,3," Concerning criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, ( Official Gazette No 04/08 ) 3 of 31 "
34,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4,"Commonly used as an adjective describing something that includes uses or is related to computers, and especially the Internet, The original term cybernetics ( kibernetika in Croatian ), was formed in the mid-twentieth century and it denotes a science of automatic control systems and control processes in biological, technical, Economic and other systems in general"
35,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4,", The adjectival form cybernetic ( kibernetiki in Croatian ), is used nowadays in the Croatian language in a similar way, with the same previously introduced, meaning as the prefix cyber- has in the English language"
36,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4," The term cybernetics is nowadays rarely used in the Croatian language, with its original meaning, like the term cybernetics in the English language"
37,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4,", The term predominantly used in technical sciences dealing with systems control is automatic"
38,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4,", The term much more common in the broader sense of meaning of the concept of cybernetics, referring to control processes in different systems, is systems theory introduced in the second half of the past century, Recognising the importance of security within cyberspace as a common responsibility of all The societys segments prompted the making of this Strategy"

45,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4," This is particularly important for ensuring the required level of understanding of the complex, operational and technical issues of cyber security, which is necessary for the central public authorities and decision makers in all the sectors of the society, as it is for the security of the citizens"
46,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4," Prosperity of the entire society, and thus for the end goal of this Strategy, implementing the law and respecting all the fundamental human rights in the new virtual dimension of the society"
47,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4," In order to cover the very broad and complex area of this Strategy and harmonise the joint efforts of the numerous stakeholders that participated in the making of this Strategy, the method applied for developing its contents included defining the basic principles of approach to the area of cyber Security, defining the objectives of the Strategy and the scope of application of the Strategy in relation to the entire society"
48,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4, Following from the above Croatias priority areas of cyber security were determined and they were analysed primarily in relation to the general goals of the Strategy
49,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,4, 4 of 31 
50,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5,Were defined in the same way for each of the cyber security areas determined in the Strategy
51,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5," Implementation, measures for those objectives will be elaborated in more detail in the action plan for the implementation of the Strategy"
52,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5," In this way, it was possible to also include the particularities of each individual area related to the society sectors defined by the Strategy and forms of mutual cooperation and coordination of various cyber security stakeholders"
53,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5," The interrelations of cyber security areas were defined in order to also cover those cyber security segments which, according to estimates, are common for most or all of the previously determined cyber security areas"
54,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5, The interrelations of cyber security areas are very important for improving and achieving more efficiently
55,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5," The objectives and measures in cyber security, areas"
56,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5, Special objectives are therefore also defined in the Strategy for the interrelations of cyber security areas
57,Croatia%20CR%20NCSS%20EN.pdf,5, Those objectives are considered to have key importance in improving the level of security in cyberspace
