20,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," However, digital networking also exposes information and communication infrastructure to criminal intelligence, politico-military or terrorist abuse or functional impairment"
21,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, Manipulation and specific attacks carried out via electronic networks are the risks that an information society entails
22,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, It is to be expected that these risks will tend to increase in the future
23,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, As the protection of information and communication infrastructure from cyber threats is in Switzerland's national interest
24,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, The Federal Council commissioned the national strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks
25,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," The Federal Council is pursuing the following strategic goals: Early identification of threats and dangers in the cyber field; Improvement of the resilience of critical infrastructure, Effective reduction of cyber risks, especially cyber crime, and cyber sabotage"
26,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," This strategy also takes account of several parliamentary proposals, calling for stronger measures against cyber risks"
27,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3,", Essential basic conditions and prerequisites for reducing cyber risks are and remain acting with personal responsibility, national cooperation between the private and public sector and cooperation with foreign countries"
28,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, The mutual exchange of information on a permanent basis is to create transparency and trust
29,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, The state should intervene only if public interests are at stake or if acting in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity
30,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," Dealing with cyber risks is to be understood as part of an integrated business production and administration process, in which all players from the administrative and technical levels up to top management must be included"
31,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," An effective approach for handling cyber risks is founded on the principle that a great many existing tasks and responsibilities of authorities, the private sector and the population exhibit cyber-specific aspects"
32,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," The rationale underlying the national strategy is that every organisational unit, be it political, economic or social - bears responsibility for identifying these cyber aspects, addressing the risks entailed in their particular processes and reducing them insofar as possible"
33,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, The decentralised structures in the public and private sector are to Be strengthened for these tasks and existing resources and processes are to be used
34,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3, The ongoing combination of technical and non-technical information is necessary to analyse and assess cyber risks comprehensively in order for it to be possible to disseminate the findings from the investigations
35,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," A crisis situation is characterised by a successful attack with considerable consequences and requires a specific form of crisis management from the players involved, including criminal prosecution"
36,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,3," Against this background, this strategy proposes a series of concrete measures with seven spheres of action: "

61,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5," Such attacks can be launched by a variety of perpetrators and have various motives: individual perpetrators, political activists, criminal organisations, intent on fraud or blackmail, state spies or terrorists who want to disrupt and destabilise the state and society"
62,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5, Information and communication technologies
63,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5," ( ICT ) are particularly attractive as targets, not only because they offer many possibilities for abuse, manipulation and damage, but also because they can be used anonymously and with little effort"
64,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5, Information and communication infrastructure from such disturbances and attacks is in Switzerland's national interest
65,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5," Although measures have been taken in recent years to reduce cyber risks2, it has become evident that these have not been sufficient for all cases"
66,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5,", Because it is to be expected that there will be an increase in disruptions and attacks on information and communication infrastructure (, thereby affecting Further facilities as well ), the Federal Council instructed the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport ( DDPS ) on 10 December 2010, to prepare a national strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks"
67,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5, This strategy is to demonstrate what these risks look like
68,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,5," At present, how well Switzerland is equipped to counter them where the shortcomings lie and how they can be eliminated in the most effective and efficient manner"

87,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6, A great deal of services are offered and used through electronic channels today
88,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6," Consequently, the presence of all Internet players and their dependence on critical infrastructure are growing4"
89,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6, The private sector is thus very vulnerable to cyber risks
90,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6, attacks with the intent to commit fraud or obtain financial gain or industrial espionage
91,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6," It is thus essential to include the private sector, particularly CI operators, ICT service providers and system suppliers in a strategy aimed at protecting against cyber risks"
92,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6," Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure can have particularly severe consequences as they can compromise, vitally important functions or trigger fatal chain reactions"
93,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6," Therefore, ( often private ) CI operators play a key role as providers of important services with overriding security implications, State authorities and administrations at all levels"

101,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6, It is therefore in the best interests of users to devise and implement tailor-made solutions for area or branch- specific problems
102,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,6, This approach also corresponds to Switzerland's characteristic: decentralised economic and state structure

595,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26," Therefore, the capabilities and perceptions at the various levels vary considerably"
596,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26," They are often inadequate, only partially coordinated and largely dictated by commercial interests"
597,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26, The measures planned or introduced risk assessments and are correspondingly heterogeneous
598,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26, They lead to uncoordinated approaches
599,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26, The exchange of information between the players barely functions and is often limited to a single entity or area
600,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26, Cyber security deficiencies are often due to a lack of financial and human resources
601,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26," This applies not only to the private sector, but also particularly to the Confederation, where human resources are insufficient, with the result that, even in a normal situation, core tasks can only be performed in a sketchy manner"
602,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,26, Another problem is the generally perceived lack of ICT specialists

610,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27," Furthermore, there is a lack of risk, analyses and definitions for ICT infrastructure security requirements derived from such analyses, as well as the ensuing distribution of responsibilities and additional costs"

614,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27," Overall, it can be noted that the current system is scarcely in a position to actively ward off major targeted cyber attacks or to eliminate their consequences in the necessary timeframe if they are severe"
615,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27," The companies and CI operators questioned are therefore calling for minimum security requirements to be defined and implemented in conjunction with the authorities and for the measures to improve the security situation, deal with attacks and raise awareness to be better coordinated"

618,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27," Accordingly, a solution in the form of a single cyber-specific act is inappropriate"
619,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27, The existing body of laws therefore has to be adapted on an ongoing basis to cyberspace developments within their scope by means of revisions
620,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27," Furthermore, increasing international networking and cooperation to minimise cyber risks can be observed"
621,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27, Based on this recognised need for action
622,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,27, This strategy proposes a series of concrete measures which are presented below 
623,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28,4 SYSTEM FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBER RISKS - 1 Overriding goals
624,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28," The Federal Council recognises that the cyber problem is primarily linked to its influence on existing tasks and responsibilities of authorities, the private sector and society"
625,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28, Minimising cyber risks is thus a matter for the relevant responsible parties

627,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28," However, it also notes that developments in this area are associated with risks and that corresponding measures to minimise these are necessary"
628,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28, This national strategy governs the application of the described measures in times of peace and thus explicitly excludes war
629,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28, With the national strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks
630,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28, The Federal Council pursues the following overriding goals
631,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28," Cyber risks are to be recognised and evaluated at an early stage in order for risk, reducing and preventive measures to be taken in cooperation with all those involved in the private sector, political circles and society The resilience of critical infrastructure to cyber attacks, in other words, the Ability to resume normal operations as quickly as possible is to be increased in cooperation with their operators, ICT service providers system suppliers and the Confederation's programme to protect critical infrastructure, ( CIP programme ) Prerequisites are to be ensured for an effective reduction of cyber risks, particularly cyber Crime, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage and, where necessary, created anew"
632,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28, These goals can be achieved in the existing decentralised structures in various ways
633,Switzerland_2012_National_strategy_for_the_protection_of_Switzerland_against_cyber_risks-EN.pdf,28,", In any case, acting with personal responsibility in the different private sector areas, as well as dialogue and cooperation between the private sector and the authorities are essential, prerequisites"
