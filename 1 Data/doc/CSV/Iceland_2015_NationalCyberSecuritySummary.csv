19,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4,Introduction A task force to address strategy on cyber security in Iceland was appointed by the Ministry of the Interior in June 2013
20,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, Its main task is to formulate government strategy on cyber security and the protection of IT infrastructure elements that are relevant to national security i
21,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, the IT systems of key institutions in Icelandic society
22,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," Most of these systems are in turn, linked to other IT systems in one way or another, via the Internet"
23,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, Demarcation of the strategy
24,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, The strategy is intended to address the protection of important elements of the infrastructure in Iceland and the responses called for
25,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," In view of the growing cyber-threats which pose a hazard to the government, the economy and the ordinary citizen"
26,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4,", The Internet has already become an integral part of the daily life of almost all people in Iceland and will continue to do so to an ever-greater degree"
27,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, In this Environment security is of paramount importance
28,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, Hence the strategy covers all use of the Internet and Information Technology
29,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, The social aims of the strategy are as follows: To enhance the security of individuals and groups in society by increasing cyber security
30,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, To promote the integrated functioning of important elements of the infrastructure of society by increasing the resilience of cyber systems to cope with hazards
31,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," To establish closer collaboration and coordination on cyber security between Icelandic and international authorities, Efficient collaboration must be established between Icelandic and international authorities, with a demarcation of the division of responsibilities and tasks between them in the field of cyber security"
32,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," In drawing up the strategy, attention was given to various other strategies in this field, both in Iceland and in the other Nordic countries, and also those of international organisations of which Iceland is a member"
33,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," Force consists of Sigurur Emil Plsson, a specialist at the Ministry of the Interior, ( Chairman ) Gubjrg Sigurardttir, Head of Department in charge of the Information Society Project at the Ministry of the Interior, Pll Heiar Halldrsson and Ott V"

37,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, The task force focused on reviewing the general foundations and recommendations on which strategies in this area have been based
38,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," The strategies of some of the other Nordic countries were examined and discussions were held with domestic and foreign parties, consultants and government officials on various aspects of information security"
39,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, The task force also discussed the threats and opportunities that have been defined and the experience gained from the plans of action already been put into practice
40,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, In other Nordic countries
41,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4,", A well-attended consultative meeting with stakeholders was held on 2 June 2014"
42,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4, Those present included about 80 representatives of some 60 institutions and enterprises
43,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,4," Another similar meeting, "
44,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5,Held on 15 January 2015 was attended by about 60 people
45,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, The views voiced at these meetings were taken into consideration in drawing up the strategy
46,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Connection with other strategies and parliamentary resolutions
47,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Direct and indirect links exist between the strategy on cyber security and many other official strategies and resolutions, e"
48,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," the national strategy on civil protection and public security law enforcement, telecommunications, the planned strategy on national security and the Icelandic State and Municipal Policy on the Information Society"
49,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," E-Power Expansion create connect, participate Strategy and action in Iceland, Taking the initiative on security, The threats and challenges outlined above call for responses"
50,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, The situation presents an important opportunity to forge ahead and make Icelands IT environment more secure and more competitive in the international context
51,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Generally prioritising security straight away at the initial planning stage means that expensive situations can be avoided later
52,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Integrating security considerations in the initial plan makes it possible to design reliable computer systems, just as sound foundations make it possible to build a skyscraper without them"
53,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, The project remains a castle in the air
54,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Priority must be given to security by design and privacy by design i
55,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, the inclusion of security and privacy considerations from the outset in the design process
56,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Cyber security must form a part of computer-related studies at all levels of the educational system
57,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Moreover, such studies at university level must be upgraded with closer collaboration with universities abroad, to enable students graduating from Icelandic universities to undertake postgraduate studies in cyber security"
58,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, It is likely that ever more stringent security requirements will be made on the market for software and software-related services
59,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Many states intend to make use of this opportunity to create for themselves a competitive advantage over others and offer an IT environment, supporting the needs of commerce, industry and private individuals"
60,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, This could involve both a more secure environment for e-commerce and also being in the forefront of cyber security and making it into a valuable export
61,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Defence against industrial espionage is also an important aspect of this, since such espionage constitutes a large part of the economic damage caused by cyber security"
62,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Consultancies are starting to use nations cyber security status as a factor in their advice on choice of location for enterprises which intend to set up data centres or other computer-related services
63,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, The legal environment in Iceland must also support software-related development and provide protection against cybercrime
64,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, In order to deter criminal organisations from seeing the country as a suitable venue for their activities because of low level of cyber security
65,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," At any given time, steps must be taken to evaluate how Icelands legislation stands in comparison with that of the other Nordic countries"
66,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Furthermore, the police must have the powers to enforce this legislation"
67,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Particular attention must be given to the protection of personal data
68,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," Technical developments and standards can change very rapidly, and it is important that the level of protection in Iceland is not lower than in other Nordic countries"
69,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Considerable results can also be achieved through simple awareness-raising
70,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5," By employing relatively simple precautionary measures, it is believed that hazards both to private individuals and enterprises can be reduced"
71,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, A great deal is at stake when it comes to combating cybercrime
72,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, Defences must be raised around important elements in the infrastructure in Iceland
73,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, This is a many- faceted task
74,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,5, It is important to have a high-capacity cyber security team capable of analysing and evaluating cyber-attacks of various types and providing assistance in the case of attacks
75,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6,Telecommunications systems and the primary data transmission networks must be reliable
76,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," IT and IT security in public administration must be enhanced, for example, regarding coordination, education and awareness-raising"
77,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," The main basis of Icelands security and defence lies in the countrys collaboration with NATO, active collaboration with other Nordic countries and the Defence Agreement with the United States"
78,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, It also includes the IT infrastructures mentioned above
79,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, The protection of the infrastructures on which these activities rely in Iceland is therefore one of the most important aspects of Icelands national defence
80,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," In view of this, the agreement signed recently with NATOs Cyber Defence Management Board will lead to increased collaboration in this field"
81,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," As an indication of the importance attached by NATO to cyber security, it was decided that cyber-attacks could be classified under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty"
82,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," Increased collaboration with other international organisations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe can also promote cyber security in Iceland"
83,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, A great deal can be gained from taking the initiative and forging ahead in this area
84,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, Building up cyber security is a challenge that no single entity in our society can undertake
85,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, To ensure optimum results
86,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, It is necessary to approach the task in a comprehensive manner involving as many IT users as possible
87,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," Both government institutions and private companies, in addition to individuals, should be included in this process"
88,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, It is important to begin this work immediately and create a common forum for development and collaboration e
89,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," regarding security standards, coordination, identification of cyber security threats and the organisation of responses"
90,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," Last but not least, it is important to be aware of the fact that this will be an on-going process subject to continual review as it progresses with new challenges calling for new solutions"
91,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, The strategy envisages the development of cyber security along the same lines as other aspects of civil protection and security
92,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6,In the event of a catastrophe or cyber-threat
93,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," The emphasis will be on the rapid exchange of information between the parties concerned in order to minimise and mitigate damage, after which work will proceed on the next steps to be taken"
94,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," Assessment and recovery measures will follow the same pattern, as is described in the civil defence programme"
95,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," Furthermore, the event will be analysed in order to learn as much as possible from it"
96,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6," If the event is caused by human agents, then it must also be guaranteed that an efficient police investigation can go ahead"
97,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6,"Review of the strategy and action plan, This strategy shall be examined and reviewed as necessary at minimum"
98,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, Measures based on the strategy shall be designed to cover shorter periods and shall be reviewed at least once a year
99,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,6, Procedure in implementing the strategy shall be in the spirit of public administration
100,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7," In order to put the cyber security strategy into action, it is proposed that a special cyber security council shall be appointed consisting of representatives of the government bodies involved in the implementation of the strategy"
101,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7," Moreover, a cyber security forum should be set up representing stakeholders, both public and private entities"
102,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7," The Cyber Security Council Supervision of implementation of the strategy is to be the responsibility of the Cyber Security Council, which will be appointed by the Minister of the Interior"
103,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7," The Cyber Security Council will coordinate measures, particularly those involving government bodies"
104,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7, It will review the action plan at least once a year and make proposals on the prioritisation and funding of measures taken
105,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7," The Cyber Security Council will submit a report to the Minister of the Interior every year on implementation of the strategy, The Cyber Security Forum"
106,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7, This is a collaborative venue for representatives of public bodies who sit on the Cyber Security Council and of private entities
107,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7, The forum will be able to coordinate projects involving stakeholders in part or in their entirety and create a basis for collaboration on specific projects addressing cyber security
108,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7," In demarcated areas, "

115,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,7,"Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, "
116,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8,The measures planned for the first period will call for a special effort to establish the broad collaboration needed between the government and stakeholders
117,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," According to the plan, these measures will be reviewed annually in subsequent periods"
118,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8, Procedure will be harmonised with normal standards of other strategy applications
119,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8, The strategy is intended to form the basis of collaboration and development in cyber security
120,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," The strategy itself will not change the responsibilities and duties of those involved in cyber security, even though proposals may be made for measures that may involve changes in these areas"
121,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," To implement the strategy, a collaborative forum, the Cyber Security Forum will be set up in the first Half of 2015"
122,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8,", The forum is the venue for planning individual measures in detail with cost estimates"
123,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8,", As many of these measures involve coordination in the work of various entities"
124,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8, Special funding is not needed to begin
125,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," Nevertheless, to ensure the effort will have sufficient capacity about ISK, 20 million will probably be needed to pay for coordination reports and educational/training/awareness-raising work"
126,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8, It is envisaged that enterprises ( companies ) will provide the funds to meet part of the costs of some of the projects
127,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," For projects requiring public funding will be submitted to the Cyber Security Council, which will make proposals on priority ranking of projects following consultation with stakeholders"
128,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," At the end of each period, the Cyber Security Council will compile a report based on summaries submitted by those responsible for all the measures give an account of the results of the work and submit proposals following consultation with stakeholders on a plan of action for the next Three years"
129,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8,": The aim is that the work of the Cyber Security Council will be transparent, minutes of meetings and other materials will be published, except where publication would be contrary to law"
130,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,8," In view of personal data protection considerations, "
131,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," 1 Capacity building The public enterprises and government should have the knowledge, skills and equipment needed to cope with cyber security"
132,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, Knowledge is the prerequisite for being able to build up capacity in cyber security
133,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, The challenge is similar to that in raising the level of traffic safety
134,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," There is a technical side similar to having the highest possible standards of vehicle safety and well-constructed roads, etc"
135,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," The ordinary person does not need to be a qualified mechanic to enjoy traffic safety, but he does need to be an active participant in traffic with a certain knowledge Of what constitutes safe vehicles and safe behaviour this applying both to his own and to others for his own good and that of other road-users"
136,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9,", An active interest in security need not be daunting or difficult"
137,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," On the contrary, it makes things easier for everyone"
138,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," Security issues must be a part of peoples, use of computers and other equipment from the outset when children are first introduced to them and so on up through the school system"
139,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, Awareness-Raising is a key component in the cyber security strategies of most of our neighbouring countries
140,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, It must extend to the design and use of equipment and respect for personal data
141,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, In Iceland as elsewhere
142,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, Part of this knowledge involves how we speak about the subject i
143,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, the vocabulary and use of terminology
144,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," If the subject is to thrive and develop, it will be necessary to standardise and coordinate this terminology"
145,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, There must also be a clear division of responsibilities
146,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, Defining who is to do what? How much responsibility lies with each user and what expectations can reasonably be made of others
147,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9,? Iceland has experts who have worked successfully together for many years
148,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9," Nevertheless, it is a major challenge to develop a reliable foundation on which to build a cyber security culture"
149,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,9, The degree to which such a culture is established is one of the factors that investors take into account when they assess countries as potential locations for new projects

156,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10, Monitoring and response capacity must be increased so as to respond to abnormal situations on the Internet
157,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10," Nevertheless, full regard must be given to appropriate considerations of personal data integrity"
158,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10, It must be possible for key entities to exchange information about possible threats
159,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10," Therefore, it is important to establish one or more collaborative forums on which information on cyber security threats can be shared"
160,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10," In a clearly defined manner, without infringement of competition or personal data considerations"
161,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10,", This could require mediation through a public body to ensure that it is possible to share information on cyber-threats quickly without revealing the identity of the target"
162,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10, The pace of development in the field of cyber security is very rapid
163,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10," For this reason, it is important that all entities involved are active in international collaboration"
164,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10, Each in its respective area
165,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10," Close collaboration between stakeholders in Iceland, with efficient exchange of information, will make it possible to respond jointly to rapid change"
166,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10," Active participation in international collaboration is also necessary to maintain flexibility, skills and contacts and be able to work with other national and supranational authorities when a crisis on the Internet looms"
167,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10, It is also vital that Iceland presents a single coordinated strategy in cyber security matters
168,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10, When the country takes part in international collaboration
169,Iceland_2015_NationalCyberSecuritySummary.pdf,10,", Increased resilience in information systems will depend on reliable design"
