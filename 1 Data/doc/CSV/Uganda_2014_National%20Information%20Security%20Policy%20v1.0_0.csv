28,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6, The policy outlines the mandatory minimum security controls that all public and private sector organisations that use own and/or operate
29,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6, Protected computers handle official communications and personal data must apply to reduce their vulnerability to cyber threats
30,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6, The use of the security measures mandated by this policy would increase the capacity of organisations to endure and recover from cyber attacks
31,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6,"Applicability of National Information Security Policy, As noted above this policy, is mandatory for all public and private sector organisations that use own and/or operate, protected computers handle official communications and personal data"
32,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6, In accordance with the Computer Misuse Act 2011
33,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," The term protected computers refers to computers used directly in connection with or necessary for Ugandas security, defence diplomacy, law enforcement, communications infrastructure, banking and financial services, public utilities, public key infrastructure and public safety"
34,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," In this policy, official communications encompass information that Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Local Governments"
35,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6, ( MDALs ) create and process during their day-to-day business
36,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6, Official communications have lower security sensitivity than data handled by protected computers
37,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," However, the loss, theft and unauthorised disclosure of official communications could have negative consequences on the MDALs"
38,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," Lastly, personal data covers data that relates to an individual "
39,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6,"Critical Infrastructure, ( CI ) "
40,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6,"In this policy, critical infrastructure is the collective term for all systems used directly in connection with or necessary for protected computer activities, the handling of official communications and personal data"
41,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," This policy adopts the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) s definition of critical infrastructure, ( CI )"
42,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," Hence in this policy, CI comprises of key systems, services and functions whose disruption or destruction would have a debilitating impact on public health and safety, commerce and national security or any combination of these"
43,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," According to the ITU, CI encompasses physical elements such as facilities, buildings and equipment, and virtual elements such as systems and data"
44,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," The ITU further observes that the physical and virtual elements of the infrastructure include human aspects, such as the protection of personnel and the mitigation of the insider threat"
45,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,6," This policy addresses all aspects of the ITU definition of CI because it covers governance, information, personnel and physical security"
46,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7,"Critical Information Infrastructure, (, CII, ) "
47,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7,"The ITU regards Critical Information Infrastructure, ( CII ) as the virtual element of critical infrastructure"
48,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," The information and communication technologies, ( ICTs ) that form CII increasingly operate and control critical national sectors such as health, water, transport, communications, government, energy, food finance and emergency services, their physical Assets and the activities of personnel "
49,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7,"Nita-U shall review this policy at least annually to help ensure that it maintains relevance to business, needs cyber threats and approaches for countering them"

52,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," The policy presents a set of mandatory minimum-security requirements under four headings or parts which are Security, governance, "
53,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7,Adaptation of Security Controls 
54,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7,It is important to stress that the mandated minimum requirements contained in this policy define baseline security controls only
55,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," In reality, organisations would have to do more than merely apply the basic security controls"
56,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," As a result, organisations must adapt the security controls provided for by this policy to their circumstances"
57,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," Adaptation is inevitable, because critical infrastructures reside in many sectors, broadly grouped into health and safety, commerce and national security"
58,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," Therefore, organisations acting through their Boards must determine the additional security controls that they must apply to mitigate to acceptable levels"
59,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7, The cyber threats relevant to their business activities
60,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,7," Boards must reach decisions on the level of security controls appropriate for their organisations by considering their own articulated Risk Appetite, business needs and the value, sensitivity and criticality of the information assets under consideration"

82,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9,The guiding principles below influence actions and decisions within this policy 
83,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9,The first principle is that the most senior person in the organisation must assume ultimate accountability for information
84,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9, Cabinet Ministers should ensure that MDALs report on their information risk position at least annually 
85,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9,"The principle requires all individuals to accept a collective duty to contribute to efforts to ensure that critical infrastructure assets and services obtain protection commensurate with their value, sensitive and criticality to their organisations"
86,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9,Individuals must understand and accept personal accountability for safeguarding the assets entrusted to them and expect to answer for and/or face sanctions for breaching security rules
87,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9,Organisations must adapt security controls to their circumstances
88,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,9," In particular, their business needs risk appetite, value and sensitivity of their information"

92,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,10,This principle requires organisations to build capacity to withstand and recover from cyber attacks and disruptions in a timely manner with minimal damage
93,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,12,"Security governance focuses on all the activities required to manage a functional area, namely information personnel and physical security"
94,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,12," This policy adopts the US ISO/IEC 27001 Plan-Do-Check-Act ( PDCA ) continuous improvement model to structure all security governance processes, as illustrated below "

100,Uganda_2014_National%20Information%20Security%20Policy%20v1.0_0.pdf,13," Given that Boards must consider all the major risks affecting their organisations, it is crucial that they issue a policy statement on information security"
