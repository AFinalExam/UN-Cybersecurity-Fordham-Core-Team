F OREWORD

The advent of the Internet marks our time. Cyberspace has increasingly become the domain
through which the citizen’sfandamental liberties of information, expression and association are
fulﬁlled, the transparency of public policies is pursued and the efﬁciency of public administrations is
stimulated, growth and innovation are attained. In this global virtual arena) billions ofconnections
are set everyday across geographical borders) knowledge is shared) and the world as we know it is
redesigned at an unprecedented speed.

The securig/ and the prosperity of any Country increasingly) depend on the protection of the I CT
networks that hast this evergrowing wealth ofknowledge and connections, and it is therefore more
and more compelling to ensure in cyberspace the respect of the rights and duties already preserved
in the civil society) in the economicfahric of the society) and in the International Community.
The digital arena is not a space outside of the lam and it is our duty to guarantee that also in
this domain the democratic principles anal values in which we believe are uphold and the norms
preserving individual libertieg equality andﬁeea’om are saﬁgaarded. Likewise, it is only in an
environment 0ftmst and mutual respect that it will be possible to fully reap the opportunities of
growth oﬁrered by digital platforms, and to secure the development of an open, safe and reliable
cyberspacefor the heneﬁ t of our ﬁnancial system, our companies and our consumers.

The ever—increasing reliance ofmodern societies on cyberspace implies that the harm occurring
in case of a disruption of the ICT inﬂastmctnre or in the event ofattacles carried out throughout
the ICT networks could he dreadful at the least. Threats can stem ﬁom any point of the world
wide web, and they often hit the weakest links) such as the most vulnerable individuals and the
least protected computer systems and ICT networks. Appalling crimes are carried out through
the world wide web) such as the exchange ofchild pornography) and online thefts andﬁ'ands can
severely damage individual wealth and valuables) hampering the necessary le1/el 0ftmst within
the digital community. Cybercrime is a plague that can cause the bankruptcy of ﬁrms and the
theft of their intellectual property, crippling the wealth of an entire nation. We assist with growing
concern to an increasingly insidious threat that exploits I CT vulnerabilities to stealthily steal the
results ofonr research and development efforts in the ﬁeld of new technologies and products. For

a conntiy like Italy, which places innovation at the cornerstone of its growth and competitiveness,
National strategic framework for cyberspace security

the potential harm is inealenlahle. Given the growing degree ofsophistieation ofcyher attacks
and the ever—increasing dependency afowr inﬂastmctares on ICT networks, our very national
stahility and security are at risk. It is therefore essential to enmre the ﬁnest possible protection of
our critical I C Tassets from attack: that can potentially have devastating eﬁ‘ects) as it would he the
ease in the event of cyher attack: impeding or mhverting the correctﬁwnctioning of the national
transport system or of energy grids) or even ofoar military Command and Control centers. It is
therefore necessaiy to develop and uphold an innovative defence posture, one that is ahle to engage
the private sector and leverage its skills in the protection of the critical I CT that the latter owns and
operates, and that factors the cyher dimension offntnre conﬂicts in its strategic doctrine and in the
capahility planningproeess.

Networks interdependence, the intrinsic asymmetry of the cyher threat, and the pereasiveness
ofcyherspace in all aspects of everyday life are all features that call for a holistic approach and
the synergic eﬂrorts of all involved stakeholders if we are to ensure an adequate level ofsecmity
in cyherspaee. The ultimate ohjectiues must he to strengthen our collective ahility t0 preempt an
attack, to detect it while it happens, to react to it, to mitigate its effects, to attribute its origin, and
to rapidly restore the originalfnnctionality, while at the same time retaining the lessons learned
ﬂom the case.

At the international level) Italy isﬁwlly engaged in multilateral institutions, ﬁrst of all within
the E U and NATO, as well as with all 0w hilateral partners, to promote the endorsement and
respect of a set ofrnles of behavior in the digital arena that is consistent with our values, and to
facilitate the emergence of a shared approach to eyherspace governance, so that the International
Community as a whole can effectively cope with the challenges laying ahead. At the domestic level,
it is ofoatmost importance the promotion of a well»caordinated and multidimensional approach
in order to prouidefor the convergence ofall Pnhlic Administrations efforts toward the achievement
afohjectiues that are matnally reinforcing with those of the private sector and the academia.

In the current ﬁnancial and economic tightening, we cannot allow for any duplication of
eﬁ‘orts and we must therefore seek any possihle synergy) keeping in mind that the hndget allocation
that will he necessany constitute not only a net saving ifcompared with the possihle damage cyher

attacks can entail but also an extraordinary opportunity of cultural social and economicgrowth.
In line with what is setforth in the Prime Minister’s Decree of the 24th January 2013, the
present National Cyhersemrity Strategic Framework highlights the nature and the evolving trends
of the cyber threat as well as of the vulnerabilities to the national I CT networks) it outlines roles
and tasks ofpuhlic and private stakeholders involved in cyhersemrity) and identiﬁes tools and
procedures to enhance the country’s preparedness to conﬂont head—on the new challengesposed by
cyberspace. The attached National Plan identiﬁes a limited set of priorities, and provides speciﬁc
objectives andgmdelines in order to give concrete implementation to the Strategic Framework.
With these two documents Italy sets out a strategy around which to coordinate all efforts, :0
that we com ﬁtce with conﬁdence the security threats and challenges stemming from cyberspace,

andpwme our national interest where the wealth of nations will more and more prosper.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Following the adoption of the Prime
Minister’s “Decree Containing Strategic
Cyber
Protection and ICF Security” of the

Guidelines For the National
24th January 2013, the Cybersecurity
Working Group was established on the
3rd of April 2013 under the auspices of
the Committee For the Security of the
Republic, chaired by the Department
for Intelligence and Security (DIS), and
developed this National Cybersecurity
Strategic Framework.

The Cybersecurity Working Group
saw the active participation of all the
Administrations already represented in
the Committee For the Security of the
Republic (Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
Interior, Defence, Justice, Economy
and Finance, Economic Development),
and included the Agency in charge For
the Italian Digital Agenda as well as
the Cybersecurity Unit within the Prime
Minister’s Ofﬁce.

The pointofdeparture oFthis National
Cybersecurity Strategic Framework is
an assessment of today’s cyber threat.
The growing importance of services

provided through cyberspace in everyday

life — From simple online payments to
the management of strategic and critical
national infrastructures — implies that also
the cyber threat is becoming more and
more pervasive and subtle, and yet it is still
widely unnoticed and underestimated. In
the ﬁrst chapter, ”The Nature and the
Evolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and
ofthe Vulnerabilities oFthe National ICT
Infrastructures", the major cyber threats
and their actors will be acknowledged —
from cybercrime to cyber espionage and
cyber terrorism, From hacktivism to cyber
sabotage, concluding with cyber warfare
— and a brief taxonomy of the cyber
organizational, procedural and technical
vulnerabilities will be proposed.
Cyberspace is a man-made domain
essentially composed of ICF nodes and
networks, hosting and processing an
ever-increasing wealth ofdata of strategic
importance for States, ﬁrms, and citizens
alike, and For all political, social and
economic decision-makers. The second
chapter, “Tools and Procedures to
Strengthen the National Cyber Defence
identiﬁes six

Capabilities”, strategic

guidelines around which to converge,
National strategic framework for cyberspace security

with a holistic, coherent and synergic
approach, all national efforts, so as to
enhance the country’s preparedness,
resilience and reaction capabilities. These
guidelines include: the enhancement of
the technical, operational and analytic
expertise of all institutions concerned
with the

cybersecurity; strengthening

of the cyber protection of ICI— networks

10

 

and computer systems supporting our
critical and strategic infrastructure; the
Facilitation onublic-private partnerships;
the promotion of a Culture of Security
and of cyber hygiene; the improvement
of our skills to effectively contrast online
criminal activities; the full support to
international cooperation initiatives in
the ﬁeld ofcybersecurity.
CHAPTER 1

THE NATURE AND THE EVOLVING TRENDS
OF THE CYBER THREAT AND OF THE
VULNERABILITIES OF THE NATIONAL ICT

INFRASTRUCTURES

Introduction

Deﬁnition

With the term cyberspace we refer to the
complex ofall interconnected ICT hardware
and software inﬁ'astru cture, to all data stored
in and transferred through the networks and
all connected usersy as well as to all logical
connections however established among
them. It therefore encompasses the Internet
and all communication cables, networks
and connections that support information
and data processing, including all mobile
Internet devices.

A complex challenge

The very same nature of cyberspace

the of

contemporary societies brought about by

and related transformation
the digital ecosystem are accountable For
the emergence of unprecedented cultural,
social and political issues, which require a
set ofcoherent, effective and in many cases
original solutions. As the International
Community is still very much divided with
regard to the principles and values that

apply to the cyber domain, seeking these

11

solutions, even in the most advanced
countries, is not an easy task, and it requires
a broad involvement of the private sector.
The private sector, in fact, has a key role to
play in coming up with possible solutions
to cope with the new challenges and threats
stemming From the cyberspace which For
the most part it owns and operates. The
private sector therefore has the interest and
the duty to agree with the public sector on
mutual expectations and responsibilities
in ensuring the protection of cyberspace.
Cyberspace has become a domain of
strategic importance for the economic,
social and cultural development ofnations,
and it is hence critical to balance the right
mix of pubic and private engagement in its
governance and management, taking into
account at the same time the requirements
ofnational security and public order as well
as the Fulﬁllment of all the individual and
economic liberties involved.

Balancing these often diverging
objectives is a complex endeavor, if one
considers for instance how monitoring
the technical functionality ofnetworks is
essential to allow the Fulﬁllment of the

right to privacy and the integrity ofone’s
National strategic framework for cyberspace security

communication appliances, or also
how it can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd the right
balance between the right to privacy and
the ﬁght against criminal activities such
as child pornography, drugs smuggling,
hate incitement or terrorism planning -
crimes that not only hurt individual and
social liberties, but also undermine the
very existence of an open, democratic

and free Internet.

Objectives

The present National Cybersecurity
Strategic Framework and the related
National Plan, both Foreseen by the
Prime Minister’s “Decree Containing
Strategic Guidelines for the National
Cyber Protection and ICF Security” of
the 24th January 2013, aim at enhancing
the national preparedness to respond to
present and future challenges affecting
cyberspace, and are devoted to directing
all national efforts toward common

and agreed solutions, knowing that
cybersecurity is a process rather than an
end to itself, that technical innovations
will always introduce new vulnerabilities
in the strategic and operational horizon,
and that the intrinsic nature ofthe cyber
threats makes our defence, at least For
the time being7 mostly — although not

exclusively—reactive.

The cyber threat and its actors

Deﬁnition
We deﬁne the cyber threat as the

complex ofmalicious conducts that can be

12

exercised in and throughout cyberspace,
or against cyberspace and its Fundamental
elements.Thethreatiscarried out bymeans
of cyber attacks, by which we mean more
or less automated actions of individuals
and organizations, both governmental
and non-governmental, aiming at
disrupting, damaging or impeding the
regular Functioning of computer systems,
ICT networks or supervisory control
and data acquisition systems and data
processing, or at compromising the
authenticity, the integrity, the availability
or the conﬁdentiality of data residing in
those systems or transiting through the
networks.

The most sophisticated cyber attacks
can be carried out through so called cyber-
weapons, that is a malicious software (i.e.
malware) designed to damage or alter
an IT system with the aim of causing its

malfunction, or even physical damage.

An insidious threat

A fundamental characteristic of the
cyber threat is its asymmetric nature. The
attacker:

' May strike From anywhere in the
world, as long as he is connected to
the Internet;

' Exploitsonesinglevulnerabilityto hack
into very sophisticated and otherwise
well protected computer systems;

' Attacks instantaneously, allowing
no time to mount an appropriate
reaction;

0 Can hardly be traced or even detected,
making it extremely complex For the

defender to put in place a response.
The Nature and the Evolving Trends of the CyberThreat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures

The intrinsic nature of: the cyber
threat, therefore, limits the scope of
deterrence, Favors the attack over defence,
and requires that all major stakeholders,
both public and private, implement a
continuous process ofanalysis so as to be
abletoupdatetheirsecuritystandardsand
procedures to the evolving operational

and technical circumstances

Classiﬁcation ofthe threat

Depending on the actors involved
and the goals pursued, it is possible to
distinguish Four kinds ofthreats:

' Cybercrime: all malicious activities

with a criminal intent carried out
in cyberspace, such as swindles or
internet Fraud, identity theFt, stealing
oFclata or oFintellectual property;
Cyberespionage: improperacquisition
of conﬁdential or classiﬁed data, not
necessarily ofeconomic orcommercial

value;
' Cyber terrorism: ideologically
motivated exploitations of systems’

an operational advantage of military

signiﬁcance

The economic impact of cybercrime
Th e of

companies’ data and personal assets

ever-increasing volume

information stored in cyberspace, recently

encouraged by the growing resort to cloud

13

computing, makes cyberattack potentially
very lucrative while being relatively risk‘ﬁ'ee
For the attacker. It is therefore no surprise
that the economic impact ofcybercrime is
quite worrisome. This is especially true For
countries like Italy, for which the theft of
the original scientiﬁc, technological and
companies’ know-how is a direct damage
to their existing comparative advantage,
undermining their competitiveness in the
global markets.

Computer crime is a growing concern
also because its illicit proﬁts are often
re-invested in the search of new system’s
vulnerabilities and in the development of
more sophisticated7 efﬁcient and easy-
to-use offensive capabilities, making
cybercrimeathreat onrimaryimportance
for the stability, the prosperity and the

security oFthe country.

The computer crime market

The computercrime market represents
therefore a very palatable and proﬁtable
sector For autonomous hackers and For
criminal organizations alike. They both
bolster a black market in which it is
possible to trade illegal contents (such as
drugs, child pornography or copyrighted
material) and to sell ready-to-use tooll<its
For conducting all kind of attacks and
exploitations to the computer systems
of choice, either independently or
with the technical support of criminal
organizations. This7 in turn, multiplies
the opportunities For Felonies against
assets (such as swindles, blackmail,
extortions, thefts, etc.), misappropriation

of conﬁdential information and identity
National strategic framework for cyberspace security

data (with the aim, For example7 to
demand ransoms or commit other kinds
of violations), recycling of illicit capitals,
gambling and illegal bets. By the same
token, it is more and more evident the
involvement of criminal organizations
in cyber espionage activities, often on
behalf of legitimate companies, with the
objective of stealing industrial patent,
company strategies, market researches,
analysis and description of productive

processes, etc.

14

 

The role aftl'ie State

Even though the digital arena is a
reality that transcends, from many points
of view, national borders, states are
certainly among the main stakeholders
of cyberspace) because they have the
ultimate responsibility For the protection
of ICT

territory, even if they are owned and

organizations. As such, they are in a
unique position to mount a robust cyber
operational capability.

Protecting the military command
and control networks and ensuring
their Full operational capability and
their resilience has always been a top
priority For any State. The advent
of cyberspace, and its key role in
ensuring the functioning of virtually
every national sensitive infrastructure,
industrial process and public services,
has extended the mandate of the State
to the protection of all ICT critical
networks. In Fact, the most sophisticated
cyber attacks may not only impair
and paralyze the State’s most vital
communication nodesandthe provision
ofessential public services, but may also
have potentially destructive effects iF
directed against critical infrastructures
such as, for instance, the aviation trafﬁc
management control system or dams
and energy installation’s supervisory
control

and management systems,

resulting in great physical damages
life.

The strategic advantage implicit in the

and the eventual loss of human
possibility of inﬂicting a great loss to
the enemy’s critical infrastructures by
striking at great distance makes it very
likely that future military confrontation
will entail the Full use of cyberspace. It
is therefore no surprise that nowadays
virtually every nation considers it
relevant in its Force planning to Foresee
the requirements of a cyber defence
capability that is adequate to protect

national critical ICT infrastructures

15

Espionage, sabotage, warfare and supply
chain g/ber threat

The defence of cyber networks
requires the development of an effective
and uninterrupted capability of

monitoring and analyzing all ongoing
malicious activities. States are striving
to ensure themselves with this expertise,
either directly or through proxies, and
considering in many cases also the

potential advantages of developing
aggressive tools. It is a weII-know fact that
some States already possess the capability
to penetrate public and private networks
of other States, and use this capability
For espionage and in order to map ICT
systems that could be potential targets in
case offuture attacks. In such a situation,
is also highly plausible that certain States
may consider mobilizing their national
industry to install through the ICTsupply
chain components that could allow For
Future stealthy cyber exploitation of the
end-user computer systems and ICT

infrastructure.

Hacktivism
Some cyber attacks are ideologically

motivated and have primarily a

like

the image of the target and/or causing

demonstrative intent,

damaging
a temporary malfunctioning of the
attacked ICT systems. Examples of this
type of cyber attack are the Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, that,
through coordinated attacks originating
From a number ofunaware and remotely
controlled computer (botnets), cause the

intentional overload of servers that host

speciﬁc services. Another example is the
so-called Web Defacement, that alters
the data oFa chosen Internet website with
the speciﬁc goal to cause disinformation,
defamation or simply mockery. In other
cases, hacktivists make use of malware
quite similar to the ones used by hackers
and computer criminals to surreptitiously
seize data that are owned by the
government, or that belong to companies
or individuals, in order to publically
expose them, orjust to demonstrate the

computer skills that they have.

Terrorism

It is possible that in the next Future
terrorist groups or individual “lone
wolves” might make use of cyber offence
capabilities to hit military and civil
targets. These cyberweapons might either
be ready available to terrorists through
criminals operating within the computer
crime market, or might be developed
independently by the terrorists through a
process of reverse engineering of already
existing cyber weapons. Fortunately, this
is For the time being only a hypothetical
threat, but it is essential to make sure that
potentially destructive cyber tools remain

out ofthe reach ofdangerous users.

Unexpected event, incident

The Full account of threats that stem
From cyberspace is virtually impossible
because this domain is characterized by
continuous technological innovations;
therefore unexpected developments might
confront us with new technological and
governance challenges demanding a
collective and systemic effort. Cyberspace
is a man-made domain, and as such it is
potentially ﬂawed. It is therefore necessary
to develop the necessary skills to anticipate
and prevent rare and unexpected events,

ANNEX 1

PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS’ ROLES AND

MANDATES

The Prime Minister’s Decree of
the 24th January 2013 outlined the
institutional architecture devoted to cyber
protection and ICFsecurity, one in which
the various stakeholders involved, both
from the private and the public sectors,
act in an integrated and consistent way so
as to mitigate cyberspace vulnerabilities,
identiﬁ/threats, prevent risks and enhance
the national capability to counter crisis
situations.

At the top of such architecture is
the Prime Minister, who adopts the
present National Cybersecurity Strategic
Framework and the National Plan, and
who ensures its practical implementation
of

directives. The Prime Minister is supported

through the adoption speciﬁc

gathers intelligence, produces aII-source

analysis, evaluations and Forecasts
about the cyber threat, contributes
to the promotion of cybersecurity

awareness and education, and provides
relevant information and alerts to the
Cybersecurity Unit and to other public
and private stakeholders.

The Cybersecurity Unit is established
within the Prime Minister Military
Advisor’s Ofﬁce with the mandate of
coordinating the various institutions
that compose the national cybersecurity
architecture, preventing and preparing
For situations of crisis, and For early
warning. Notwithstanding the primary
responsibility of each Administration For
the ownership, custody, protection and
