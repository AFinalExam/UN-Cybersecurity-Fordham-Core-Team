J HAT DOES THE FUTURE‘HOLD?

Brunei economic future lies in its economic diversification

ICT sector had been identified as one of the key driver in Brunei economic
development.

e—Government is not merely introducing technology for efﬁciency; instead it
is a transformation process that involves changing the mindset of the people,
culture and structure

e—Government is about restructuring and reengineering of government
business processes, the need to change their thinking and "accept the e-ways“

The implementation of e-Government program for example helps to expedite
the operational processes through the reduction of repetitive administrative
and manual tasks.

Success and failure of e-Government will be much more visible when online
governance and services meets the public (such as public participations)

e—Government require ICT capacity and capability, Business Process Re-
engineering, change of mindset, close and cohesive cooperation/collaboration
among various stakeholders that include the support and involvement from
top management to the bottom of the organizational ladder.
