INTRODUCTION

Context

The UN General Assembly Resolution 56/ 183 (21 December 2001) endorsed
the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in two
phases. The objective of the ﬁrst phase in Geneva was to develop and foster
a clear statement of political will and take concrete steps to establish
foundations for an Information Society for all, reﬂecting all the different
interests at stake. The objective of the second phase in Tunis was to put the
Geneva Plan of Action into motion as well as to ﬁnd solutions and reach
agreements in the ﬁeld of internet governance, ﬁnancing mechanisms, and
follow up and implementation of the Geneva and Tunis documents. The
WSIS Action line C5 identiﬁes the need to build conﬁdence and security in
the use of ICT’s.

The Tunis World Summit on the Information Society mandated the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to assist in further developing
the Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA), a High-Level Experts Group (HLEG)
on Cybersecurity was established to support the Secretaxy General to assist
countries to develop Cybersecurity intervention identiﬁed the following key
pillars: organisational structures, legal, technical and procedural measures,
international collaboration, and national partnership of stakeholders.

South Africa does not have a coordinated approach in dealing with
Cybersecurity. Whilst various structures have been established to deal with
Cybersecurity issues, the structures are inadequate to deal with
Cybersecurity issues holistically.

There are various legal provisions addressing Cybersecurity in South Africa.
However these provisions do not adequately address the legal challenges
South Africa faces to effectively deal with cybercrime. Bridging the
technology/law divide remains a fundamental challenge.

Securing our cyberspace also requires international collaboration given the
global nature of ICT’s. South Africa does not have extensive international
collaboration with other countries to support its Cybersecurity initiatives to
secure its cyberspace.

The development of . interventions to address cybercrime requires a

partnership between business, government and civil society. Unless these
3
1.1.7

STAATSKOERANT, 19 FEBRUARIE 2010 No. 32963 7

spheres of society work together, South Africa’s efforts to ensure a secured
cyberspace will be severely compromised.

In ensuring a secure South African cyberspace, the development,
implementation and monitoring of Cybersecurity protocols, standards
including software and hardware are a critical component. South Africa lags

behind other countn'es in this regard.

11.8 It is apparent given the issues identiﬁed that the implementation of this

1.2

1.2.1

2.1

policy goes beyond the mandate of the Department of Communications. In
recognition of the different mandates played by the various Departments, it
is inconceivable for any one Department to implement all the issues
identiﬁed in this policy. The success thereof this policy depends on the
collective efforts of all the relevant Government Departments, the
implementation of the policy Will be coordinated by the Department of

Communications.

Legislative Framework

In South Africa, there are various pieces of legislation administered by
different Government Departments that impact on Cybersecurity. This policy
acknowledges various legislations, the policy also acknowledges that the
South African Cybersecurity legal framework will not be a homogeneous
document but a collection of legislations, which when viewed collectively will

ensure that South African cyberspace is secure.

POLICY OBJECTIVES

The aim of this Policy is to establish an environment that will ensure

conﬁdence and trust in the secure use of ICTs. This will be achieved through

the following objectives:

- Facilitate the establishment of relevant structures in support of
Cybersecurity;

' Ensure the reduction of Cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities;

' Foster cooperation and coordination between government and the private
sector;

0 Promote and strengthen international cooperation on Cybersecurity;

- Build capacity and promoting a culture of Cybersecurity; and

4

3.1

0 Promote compliance with appropriate technical and operational

Cybersecurity standards.

CREATING INSTUTITIONAL CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO
CYBERCRIME AND THREATS

The increase in uptake and usage of the internet will contribute signiﬁcantly
to economic growth. This however is likely to lead to an increase in
cybercrime. In order to ensure that South African cyberspace is secured,
South Africa should establish appropriate organisational structures to

support our national Cybersecurity initiatives:

National Cybersecurity Advisory Council

Currently there is no structure that coordinates Cybersecurity policies and
interventions at operational and strategic levels. There is a need to provide
for an integrated and coordinated national approach in Cybersecurity related
issues. In response to such a need, this policy provides for the establishment
of a National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC) to coordinate all

Cybersecurity initiatives at a strategic level.

3.1.1 Role of the National Cybersecurity Advisory Council (NCAC)

The role of the NCAC is to:

' Advise the Minister of Communications on policy issues and other
matters pertinent to Cybersecurity;

- Promote intergovernmental cooperation on Cybersecurity matters;

0 Promote and encourage coordinated public-private partnerships on
issues regarding cyber security in the country;

' Assess the state of national Cybersecurity, determine needs and advise
on appropriate responses and priorities; and

' Provide oversight regarding the implementation of national

Cybersecurity initiatives and structures.
STAATSKOERANT, 19 FEBRUARIE 2010 No. 32963 9

3.2 COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAMS [CSIRT)

This policy provides for the establishment of a National CSIRT, and various
sector CSIRTs including a Government CSIRT. The National CSIRT will
identify, analyse, contain, mitigate and report the outcome of the threats to
relevant parties. Sector CSIRTs will coordinate activities in their respective

sectors and communicate with the National CSIRT.

3.2. 1 National CSIRT

The National CSIRT shall be established by the Department of
Communications in conjunction with relevant Government Departments, the
private sector and civil society. The role of the National CSIRT will include
the following:

- Act as national point of contact for the coordination of incident
handling activities, including identifying stakeholders and developing
public private relationships and collaborating with sector CSIRTs;

' Analyse incidents, vulnerabilities, threats, and other information;

- Disseminate the information to other by sector CSIRTs, vendors,
technologr experts etc.;

0 Create and maintain situational awareness concerning the risk
environment of South African cyberspace;

' Act appropriately on threats;

. Facilitate interaction, both nationally and internationally, including
through international memberships to organisations such as the
Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST); and, in
consultation with the Minister, develop policy guidelines to inform such
interaction;

' Encourage and facilitate the establishment of sector CSIRTs;

- Conduct cybersecurity audits, assessments and readiness exercises;
and

- Establish standards and best practices for South Africa for NCAC’s

consideration.

REDUCING CYBERSECURITY THREATS AND
VULNERABILITIES

There is a need for a vigilant and proactive approach to information security
through continuous mapping, assessment and prediction of potential threats
and vulnerabilities. South African cyberspace will be secured through the:
- Development of proactive measures for the prevention and combating of
cybercrime;
0 Development of technical, regulatory and legal measures for the
reduction of Cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities; and

0 Identiﬁcation and protection of critical information infrastructure (CII).

COORDINATED LOCAL AN D INTERNATIONAL
PARTNERSHIPS

The ﬁght against cybercrime and threats requires a partnership between
public sector, private sector and civil society. However, given the borderless

nature of cyberspace, national efforts are not always adequate:

Foster cooperation and coordination between government,
private sector and citizens.

Cooperation and coordination between public sector, private sector and civil
society will be fostered at strategic and operational level by the National
Advisory Council and the National CSIRT.

Promote and strengthen international cooperation

Recognising the need for global collaboration on technical and legal matters
in order to curb cybercrime, South Africa will become member and
participate in the following international organisations subject to existing
international agreements and the Constitution.
0 Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST);
0 International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Terrorism
(IMPACT); and

- Any other relevant international fora on matters of Cybersecurity.

6 CONTINOUS INNOVATION, SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AND
COMPLIANCE

The dynamic nature of cybercn'me requires the continuous development of
Research and Development (R&D) capabilities and requisite skills to mitigate
cybercrime. This policy provides for the:
0 Building capacity to address speciﬁc requirements of law enforcement,
judiciary, security practitioners and civil society; and
- Promoting a culture of Cybersecurity through the development of
programmes that address the speciﬁc needs of business, government

and users in general.
