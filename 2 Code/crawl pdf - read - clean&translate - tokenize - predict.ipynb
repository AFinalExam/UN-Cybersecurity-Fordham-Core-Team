The global community continues to experience an increase in the scale, sophistication and successful perpetration of cyber crime.  As the quantity and value of electronic information has increased so too have the efforts of criminals and other malicious actors who have embraced the Australia™s national security, economic prosperity and social wellbeing are critically dependent upon (ICT).  This includes desktop computers, the Internet, mobile communications devices and other computer systems and networks.

Companies  and  countries  rely  on  cyberspace  for  everything  from \\nfinancial transactions to the movement of military forces. Computer code blurs the line between \\nthe  cyber  and  physical  world  and  connects  millions  of  objects  to  the  Internet  or  private \\nnetworks.  Electric  firms  rely  on  industrial  control  systems  to  provide  power  to  the  grid. \\nShipping managers use satellites and the Internet to track freighters as they pass through global \\nsea lanes, and the U.S. military relies on secure networks and data to carry out its missions.  \\n \\nThe  United  States  is  committed  to  an  open,  secure,  interoperable,  and  reliable  Internet  that \\nenables  prosperity,  public  safety,  and  the  free flow  of  commerce and  ideas.  These qualities  of \\nthe  Internet  reflect  core  American  values  –  of  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy,  creativity, \\nopportunity,  and  innovation.  And  these  qualities  have  allowed  the  Internet  to  provide  social \\nand economic value to billions of people. Within the U.S. economy alone, anywhere from three \\nto 13 percent of business sector value-added is derived from Internet-related businesses. Over \\nthe last ten years Internet access increased by over two billion people across the globe.. Yet these \\nsame  qualities  of  openness  and  dynamism  that  led  to  the  Internet’s  rapid  expansion  now \\nprovide dangerous state and non-state actors with a means to undermine U.S. interests.  \\n \\nWe  are  vulnerable in  this  wired world.  Today  our  reliance  on  the  confidentiality,  availability, \\nand  integrity  of  data  stands  in  stark  contrast  to  the  inadequacy  of  our  cybersecurity.  The \\nInternet  was  not  originally  designed  with  security  in  mind,  but  as  an  open  system  to  allow \\nscientists  and  researchers  to  send  data  to  one  another  quickly.  Without  strong  investments  in \\ncybersecurity  and  cyber  defenses,  data  systems  remain  open  and  susceptible  to  rudimentary \\nand  dangerous forms  of  exploitation  and attack.  Malicious  actors  use cyberspace  to  steal  data \\nand intellectual property for their own economic or political goals. And an actor in one region \\nof the globe can use cyber capabilities to strike directly at a network thousands of miles away, \\ndestroying data, disrupting businesses, or shutting off critical systems. \\n \\nState and non-state actors conduct cyber operations to achieve a variety of political, economic, \\nor  military  objectives.  In  conducting  their  operations,  they  may  strike  at  a  nation’s  values  as \\nwell as its interests or purposes. As one example, in November, 2014, likely in retaliation for the \\n\\n \\n\\n1 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nintimidation,  and \\n\\nthe \\n\\nThe  Red  Flag  14-1  Cyber  Protection  Team  works  on  cyber  defense \\nprocedures inside the Combined Air and Space Operations Center-Nellis, \\nNellis, NV.

In  addition  to  the  destructive  nature  of  the  attacks,  North \\nKorea stole digital copies of a number of unreleased movies, as well as thousands of documents \\ncontaining  sensitive  data  regarding  celebrities, \\nSony employees, and Sony’s business operations. \\nNorth Korea accompanied their cyberattacks with \\ncoercion, \\nthreat  of \\nterrorism. The North Korean attack on Sony was \\none of the most destructive cyberattacks on a U.S. \\nentity  to  date.  The  attack  further  spurred  an \\nalready  ongoing  national  discussion  about  the \\nnature  of  the  cyber  threat  and  the  need  for \\nimproved cybersecurity.  \\n \\nThe  increased  use  of  cyberattacks  as  a  political \\ninstrument \\nin \\ninternational  relations.  Vulnerable  data  systems \\npresent  state  and  non-state  actors  with  an \\nenticing  opportunity  to  strike  the  United  States \\nand  its  interests.  During  a  conflict,  the  Defense \\nDepartment  assumes  that  a  potential  adversary \\nwill seek to target U.S. or allied critical infrastructure and military networks to gain a strategic \\nadvantage. Beyond the attacks described above, a sophisticated actor could target an industrial \\ncontrol system (ICS) on a public utility to affect public safety, or enter a network to manipulate \\nhealth  records  to  affect  an  individual’s  well-being.  A  disruptive,  manipulative,  or  destructive \\ncyberattack  could  present  a  significant  risk  to  U.S.  economic  and  national  security  if  lives  are \\nlost, property destroyed, policy objectives harmed, or economic interests affected.  \\n\\nreflects  a  dangerous \\n\\ntrend \\n\\nLeaders  must  take  steps  to  mitigate  cyber  risks.  Governments,  companies,  and  organizations \\nmust  carefully  prioritize  the  systems  and  data  that  they  need  to  protect,  assess  risks  and \\nhazards,  and  make  prudent  investments  in  cybersecurity  and  cyber  defense  capabilities  to \\nachieve their security goals and objectives. Behind these defense investments, organizations of \\nevery kind must build business continuity plans and be ready to operate in a degraded cyber \\nenvironment  where  access  to  networks  and  data  is  uncertain.  To  mitigate  risks  in  cyberspace \\nrequires  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  counter  and  if  necessary  withstand  disruptive  and \\ndestructive attacks. \\n\\nDefending the United States in Cyberspace \\n\\nIn concert with other agencies, the United States’ Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible \\nfor  defending  the  U.S.  homeland  and  U.S.  interests  from  attack,  including  attacks  that  may \\noccur in cyberspace. In a manner consistent with U.S. and international law, the Department of \\nDefense seeks to deter attacks and defend the United States against any adversary that seeks to \\nharm  U.S.  national  interests  during  times  of  peace,  crisis,  or  conflict.  To  this  end  the  Defense \\nDepartment has developed capabilities for cyber operations and is integrating those capabilities \\ninto  the  full  array  of  tools  that  the  United  States  government  uses  to  defend  U.S.  national \\ninterests, \\nlaw \\nenforcement tools.  \\n\\ninformational,  military,  economic,  financial,  and \\n\\nincluding  diplomatic, \\n\\n \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nThe  May  2011  Department  of  Defense  Strategy  for  Operating  in  Cyberspace  guided  the  Defense \\nDepartment’s cyber activities and operations in support of U.S. national interests over the last \\nfour  years.  This  new  strategy  sets  prioritized  strategic  goals  and  objectives  for  DoD’s  cyber \\nactivities and missions to achieve over the next five years. It focuses on building capabilities for \\neffective  cybersecurity  and  cyber  operations  to  defend  DoD  networks,  systems,  and \\ninformation; defend the nation against cyberattacks of significant consequence; and support \\noperational and contingency plans. This strategy builds on previous decisions regarding DoD’s \\nCyber  Mission  Force  and  cyber  workforce  development  and  provides  new  and  specific \\nguidance  to  mitigate  anticipated  risks  and  capture  opportunities  to  strengthen  U.S.  national \\nsecurity.  \\n\\nAs a matter of first principle, cybersecurity is a team effort within the U.S. Federal government. \\nTo  succeed  in  its  missions  the  Defense  Department  must  operate  in  partnership  with  other \\nDepartments and Agencies, international allies and partners, state and local governments, and, \\nmost importantly, the private sector.  \\n\\nCybersecurity Activities \\n\\nTo  support  its  missions  in  cyberspace,  the  Defense  Department  conducts  a  range  of  activities \\noutside  of  cyberspace  to  improve  collective  cybersecurity  and  protect  U.S.  interests.  For \\nexample,  the  Defense  Department  cooperates  with  agencies  of  the  U.S  government,  with  the \\nprivate  sector,  and  with  our  international  partners  to  share  information,  build  alliances  and \\npartnerships, and foster norms of responsible behavior to improve global strategic stability.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nInformation sharing and interagency coordination. To secure and advance U.S. interests in \\ncyberspace, DoD seeks to share information and coordinate with U.S. government agencies \\nin  an  integrated  fashion  on  a  range  of  cyber  activities.  For  example,  if  DoD  learns  of \\nmalicious cyber activities that will affect important U.S. networks and systems that are vital \\nfor  U.S.  national  and  economic  security  or  public  safety,  DoD  supports  agencies  like  the \\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  as \\nthey reach out to U.S. entities, and often other countries, to share threat information such as \\ntechnical indicators of a potential attack. Such \\ninformation sharing can significantly improve \\nan  organization’s  ability  to  defend  itself \\nagainst  a  broad  range  of  cyberattacks.  In \\naddition \\ninformation,  DoD \\npartners  with  other  agencies  of  the  U.S. \\ngovernment to synchronize operations and to \\nshare lessons-learned and cybersecurity best-\\npractices. This includes incident management \\nand network defense response.  \\n\\nsharing \\n\\nto \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Build  bridges  to  the  private  sector.  From \\napplication  developers  to  Internet  Services \\nProviders,  private  companies  provide  the \\ngoods and services that make up cyberspace. \\nThe Defense Department relies on the private \\nsector \\nits  networks,  provide \\ncybersecurity  services,  and  research  and \\n\\nto  build \\n\\nMr.  Joe  Sciabica  and  Maj.

The Defense Department engages \\nin a broad array of activities to improve cybersecurity and cyber operations capacity abroad. \\nDoD helps U.S. allies and partners to understand the cyber threats they face and to build the \\ncyber  capabilities  necessary  to  defend  their  networks  and  data.  Allies  and  partners  also \\noften have complementary capabilities that can augment those of the United States, and the \\nUnited States seeks to build strong alliances and coalitions to counter potential adversaries’ \\ncyber activities. Strategically, a unified coalition sends a message that the United States and \\nits  allies  and  partners  are  aligned  in  collective  defense.  In  addition to  the  Five  Eyes  treaty \\npartners,  DoD  works  closely  with  key  partners  in  the  Middle  East,  the  Asia-Pacific,  and \\nEurope to understand the cybersecurity environment and build cyber defense capacity.  \\n\\nThree Primary Missions in Cyberspace \\n\\nThe  President  has  established  principles  and  processes  for  governing  cyber  operations.  The \\npurpose  of  these  principles  and  processes  is  to  plan,  develop,  and  use  U.S.  capabilities \\neffectively,  and  to  ensure  that  cyber  operations  occur  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  values \\nthat the United States promotes domestically and internationally.  \\n\\nThe  Defense  Department  has  three  primary  cyber  missions.  First,  DoD  must  defend  its  own \\nnetworks,  systems,  and  information.  The  U.S.  military’s  dependence  on  cyberspace  for  its \\noperations led the Secretary of Defense in 2011 to declare cyberspace as an operational domain \\nfor  purposes  of  organizing,  training,  and  equipping  U.S.  military  forces.  The  Defense \\nDepartment  must  be  able  to  secure  its  own  networks  against  attack  and  recover  quickly  if \\nsecurity  measures  fail.  To  this  end,  DoD  conducts  network  defense  operations  on  an  ongoing \\nbasis  to  securely  operate  the  Department  of  Defense  Information  Network  (DoDIN).  If  and \\nwhen DoD detects indications of hostile activity within its networks, DoD has quick-response \\ncapabilities  to  close  or  mitigate  vulnerabilities  and  secure  its  networks  and  systems.  Network \\ndefense  operations  on  DoD  networks  constitute  the  vast  majority  of  DoD’s  operations  in \\ncyberspace.  \\n\\nIn  addition  to  defense  investments,  DoD  must  prepare  and  be  ready  to  operate  in  an \\nenvironment where access to cyberspace is contested. During the Cold War, forces prepared to \\noperate  in  an  environment  where  access  to  communications  could  be  interrupted  by  the \\nadversary’s advanced capabilities, to include the potential use of an electromagnetic pulse that \\ncould  disrupt  satellite  and  other  global  communications  capabilities.  Commanders  conducted \\nperiodic  exercises  that  required  their  teams  to  operate  without  access  to  communications \\nsystems. Through years of practice and exercise, a culture of resilience took root in the military \\nand units were ready and prepared to operate in contested environments.   \\n\\nSince  the  end  of  the  Cold  War,  however,  a  younger  generation  has  grown  increasingly  more \\naccustomed to an environment of connectivity. The generation of military men and women that \\ngrew  up  since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  have  had  near  constant  access  to  information  and \\ncommunications, and the information revolution has led to a more agile and globally adaptive \\nforce.  In the face of an escalating cyber threat, the lessons of the previous generations must now \\nbe passed down. The Defense Department must be able to carry out its missions to defend the \\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\ncountry. Organizations must exercise and learn to operate without the tools that have become \\nsuch a vital part of their daily lives and operations.   \\n\\nFor  its  second  mission,  DoD  must  be  prepared  to \\ndefend  the  United  States  and  its  interests  against \\ncyberattacks  of  significant  consequence.  While \\ncyberattacks are assessed on a case-by-case and fact-\\nspecific basis by the President and the U.S. national \\nsecurity team, significant consequences may include \\nloss  of  life,  significant  damage  to  property,  serious \\nadverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious \\neconomic impact on the United States.  \\n\\nIf  directed  by  the  President  or  the  Secretary  of \\nDefense,  the  U.S.  military  may  conduct  cyber \\noperations  to  counter  an  imminent  or  on-going \\nattack against the U.S. homeland or U.S. interests in \\ncyberspace.  The  purpose  of  such  a  defensive \\nmeasure  is  to  blunt  an  attack  and  prevent  the \\ndestruction of property or the loss of life. DoD seeks \\nto \\ncapabilities  with  other \\ngovernment agencies to develop a range of options \\nand  methods \\nfor  disrupting  cyberattacks  of \\nsignificant  consequence  before  they  can  have  an  impact,  to  include  law  enforcement, \\nintelligence,  and  diplomatic  tools.  As  a  matter  of  principle,  the  United  States  will  seek  to \\nexhaust all network defense and law enforcement options to mitigate any potential cyber risk to \\nthe U.S. homeland or U.S. interests before conducting a cyberspace operation.    \\n\\nNavy Petty Officer 1st Class Joel Melendez, Naval Network Warfare \\nCommand information systems analysis, Air Force Staff Sgt.

The  private  sector  owns  and  operates  over \\nninety percent of all of the networks and infrastructure of cyberspace and is thus the first line of \\ndefense. One of the most important steps for improving the United States’ overall cybersecurity \\nposture is for companies to prioritize the networks and data that they must protect and to invest \\nin improving their  own cybersecurity. While the U.S. government must prepare to defend the \\ncountry against the most dangerous attacks, the majority of intrusions can be stopped through \\nrelatively basic cybersecurity investments that companies can and must make themselves.  \\n\\nThird, if directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense, DoD must be able to provide \\nintegrated  cyber  capabilities  to  support  military  operations  and  contingency  plans.  There \\nmay be times when the President or the Secretary of Defense may determine that it would be \\nappropriate for the U.S. military to conduct cyber operations to disrupt an adversary’s military-\\nrelated networks or infrastructure so that the U.S. military can protect U.S. interests in an area \\nof operations. For example, the United States military might use cyber operations to terminate \\nan ongoing conflict on U.S. terms, or to disrupt an adversary’s military systems to prevent the \\nuse of force against U.S. interests. United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) may also be \\ndirected  to  conduct  cyber  operations,  in  coordination  with  other  U.S.  government  agencies  as \\nappropriate, to deter or defeat strategic threats in other domains.  \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nTo ensure that the Internet remains open, secure, and prosperous, the United States will always \\nconduct cyber operations under a doctrine of restraint, as required to protect human lives and \\nto  prevent  the  destruction  of  property.  As  in  other  domains  of  operations,  in  cyberspace  the \\nDefense  Department  will  always  act  in  a  way  that  reflects  enduring  U.S.  values,  including \\nsupport for the rule of law, as well as respect and protection of the freedom of expression and \\nprivacy,  the  free  flow  of  information,  commerce,  and  ideas.  Any  decision  to  conduct  cyber \\noperations outside of DoD networks is made with the utmost care and deliberation and under \\nstrict policy and operational oversight, and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.  As it \\nmakes  its  investments  and  builds  cyber  capabilities  to  defend  U.S.  national  interests,  the \\nDefense Department will always be attentive to the potential impact of defense policies on state \\nand non-state actors’ behavior. \\n\\nA New Cyber Mission Force \\n\\nThe  Defense  Department  requires  the  commitment  and  coordination  of  multiple  leaders  and \\ncommunities across DoD and the broader U.S. government to carry out its missions and execute \\nthis strategy. Defense Department law enforcement, intelligence, counterintelligence, and policy \\norganizations all have an active role, as do the men and women that build and operate DoD’s \\nnetworks  and  information  technology  systems.  Every  organization  needs  to  play  its  part.  For \\nexample,  network  service  providers  across  DoD  must  be  adaptive  and  active  to  follow \\ncybersecurity best-practices and cyber defense orders. U.S. Cyber Command must synchronize \\nits  activities  with  other  DoD  organizations,  particularly  combatant  commands,  to  respond  to \\nemerging  challenges  and  opportunities.  Installation  owners  and  operators  must  partner  with \\nthe  Military  Departments’  Computer  Emergency  Response  Teams  (CERTs),  DHS,  and \\nUSCYBERCOM to build adaptive defenses and continuity plans for mission-critical systems and \\nthe  civil  systems  that  support  them.  Success  requires  creative  and  strong  intra-Departmental \\nand interagency partnerships. \\n\\nAmong  DoD’s  cyber  personnel  and  forces,  the  Cyber  Mission  Force  (CMF)  has  a  unique  role \\nwithin the Department. In 2012, DoD began to build a CMF to carry out DoD’s cyber missions. \\nOnce  fully  operational,  the  CMF  will  include  nearly  6,200  military,  civilian,  and  contractor \\nsupport  personnel  from  across  the  military  departments  and  defense  components.  The  Cyber \\nMission  Force  represents  a  major  investment  by  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  United \\nStates as whole, and a central aim of this strategy is to set specific goals and objectives to guide \\nthe development of the Cyber Mission Force and DoD’s wider cyber workforce to protect and \\ndefend U.S. national interests.  \\n\\nThe  Cyber  Mission  Force  will  be  comprised  of  cyber  operators  organized  into  133  teams, \\nprimarily  aligned  as  follows:  Cyber  Protection  Forces  will  augment  traditional  defensive \\nmeasures  and  defend  priority  DoD  networks  and  systems  against  priority  threats;  National \\nMission  Forces  and  their  associated  support  teams  will  defend  the  United  States  and  its \\ninterests against cyberattacks of significant consequence; and Combat Mission Forces and their \\nassociated  support  teams  will  support  combatant  commands  by  generating  integrated \\ncyberspace  effects  in  support  of  operational  plans  and  contingency  operations.  Combatant \\ncommands  integrate  Combat  Mission  Forces  and  Cyber  Protection  Teams  into  plans  and \\noperations  and  employ  them  in  cyberspace,  while  the  National  Mission  Force  operates  under \\nthe  Commander  of  USCYBERCOM.    Outside  of  this  construct,  teams  can  also  be  used  to \\nsupport other missions as required by the Department.  \\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nthe  course  of \\n\\nIn 2013 the Department began to integrate the CMF into the larger multi-mission U.S. military \\nforce  to  achieve  synergy  across  domains,  assure  the  CMF’s  readiness  within  the  force,  and \\nrestructure  the  military  and  civilian  workforce  and  infrastructure  to  execute  DoD’s  missions. \\nDuring \\nthis \\nstrategy,  DoD  will  continue  to  build  the  CMF, \\nand  will  continue  to  mature  the  necessary \\ncommand,  control,  and  enabling  organizations \\nrequired for effective operations. DoD will focus \\non ensuring that its forces are trained and ready \\nto \\nand \\narchitectures \\nto  conduct  cyber \\noperations,  continue  to  build  policy  and  legal \\nframeworks  to  govern  CMF  employment,  and \\nintegrate  the  CMF  into  DoD’s  overall  planning \\nand force development. \\n\\nthe \\nthey  need \\n\\noperate  using \\n\\nimplementing \\n\\ncapabilities \\n\\nthat \\n\\nstrategy \\n\\nrecognizes \\n\\nThis \\neffective \\ncybersecurity  will  require  close  collaboration \\nwithin DoD and across the federal government, \\nwith  industry,  with  international  allies  and \\npartners, and with state and local governments. \\nThe pursuit of security in cyberspace requires a \\nwhole-of-government  and  international  approach  due  to  the  number  and  variety  of \\nstakeholders  in  the  domain,  the  flow  of  information  across  international  borders,  and  the \\ndistribution of responsibilities, authorities, and capabilities across governments and the private \\nsector.  For  each  of  DoD’s  missions,  DoD  must  continue  to  develop  routine  relationships  and \\nprocesses for coordinating its cyber operations.  \\n\\nU.S.  Strategic  Command  serves  as  the  Defense  Department’s  global \\nsynchronizer for capabilities that affect every combatant command.

Raymond Schaeffer) \\n\\nSpecific risks and opportunities inform this new strategy. For example, DoD’s own network is a \\npatchwork  of  thousands  of  networks  across  the  globe,  and  DoD  lacks  the  visibility  and \\norganizational  structure  required  to  defend  its  diffuse  networks  effectively.  The  Defense \\nDepartment  must  further  develop  adequate  warning  intelligence  of  adversary  intentions  and \\ncapabilities for conducting destructive and disruptive cyberattacks against DoD and the United \\nStates.  Beyond  its  own  networks,  DoD  relies  on  civil  critical  infrastructure  across  the  United \\nStates  and  overseas  for  its  operations,  yet  the  cybersecurity  of  such  critical  infrastructure  is \\nuncertain.  \\n\\nTo mitigate these and other risks and improve U.S. national security, this strategy sets strategic \\ngoals  for  the  Department  to  achieve,  and  prescribes  objectives  and  metrics  for  meeting  each \\ngoal.  All  of  the  goals  and  objectives  within  this  strategy  reflect  the  goals  of  the  2015  United \\nStates National Security Strategy and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. \\n\\nDoD sets five strategic goals for its cyberspace missions: \\n\\n1.  Build and maintain ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations; \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Defend  the  DoD  information  network,  secure  DoD  data,  and  mitigate  risks  to  DoD \\n\\nmissions;  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\n3.

Potential state and non-state adversaries conduct malicious cyber \\nactivities against U.S. interests globally and in a manner intended to test the limits of what the \\nUnited  States  and  the  international  community  will  tolerate.  Actors  may  penetrate  U.S. \\nnetworks and systems for a variety of reasons, such as to steal intellectual property, disrupt an \\norganization’s operations for activist purposes, or to conduct disruptive and destructive attacks \\nto achieve military objectives. \\n \\nPotential  adversaries  have  invested  significantly  in  cyber  as  it  provides  them  with  a  viable, \\nplausibly deniable capability to target the U.S. homeland and damage U.S. interests. Russia and \\nChina have developed advanced cyber capabilities and strategies. Russian actors are stealthy in \\ntheir  cyber  tradecraft  and  their  intentions  are  sometimes  difficult  to  discern.  China  steals \\nintellectual  property  (IP)  from  global  businesses  to  benefit  Chinese  companies  and  undercut \\nU.S. competitiveness. While Iran and North Korea have less developed cyber capabilities, they \\nhave  displayed  an  overt  level  of  hostile intent  towards  the  United  States  and  U.S.  interests in \\ncyberspace.   \\n \\nIn addition to state-based threats, non-state actors like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \\n(ISIL)  use  cyberspace  to  recruit  fighters  and  disseminate  propaganda  and  have  declared  their \\nintent  to  acquire  disruptive  and  destructive  cyber  capabilities.  Criminal  actors  pose  a \\nconsiderable  threat  in  cyberspace,  particularly  to  financial institutions,  and ideological  groups \\noften  use  hackers  to  further  their  political  objectives.    State  and  non-state  threats  often  also \\nblend  together;  patriotic  entities  often  act  as cyber  surrogates  for  states, and non-state  entities \\ncan provide cover for state-based operators. This behavior can make attribution more difficult \\nand increases the chance of miscalculation.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMalware Proliferation  \\n\\nThe  global  proliferation  of  malicious  code  or  software  (“malware”)  increases  the  risk  to  U.S. \\nnetworks  and  data.  To  conduct  a  disruptive  or  destructive  cyber  operation  against  a  military \\nsystem or industrial control system requires expertise, but a potential adversary need not spend \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nbillions  of  dollars  to  develop  an  offensive  capability.  A  nation-state,  non-state  group,  or \\nindividual actor can purchase destructive malware and other capabilities on the black market. \\nState  and  non-state  actors  also  pay  experts  to  search  for  vulnerabilities  and  develop  exploits. \\nThis  practice  has  created  a  dangerous  and  uncontrolled  market  that  serves  multiple  actors \\nwithin  the  international  system,  often  for  competing  purposes.    As  cyber  capabilities  become \\nmore  readily available  over  time,  the  Department  of  Defense assesses  that  state  and  non-state \\nactors will continue to seek and develop cyber capabilities to use against U.S. interests.  \\n \\nRisk to DoD Networks and Infrastructure  \\n\\nThe Defense Department’s own networks and systems are vulnerable to intrusions and attacks. \\nIn  addition  to  DoD’s  own  networks,  a  cyberattack  on  the  critical  infrastructure  and  key \\nresources  on  which  DoD  relies  for  its  operations  could  impact  the  U.S.  military’s  ability  to \\noperate  in  a  contingency.  DoD  has  made  gains  in  identifying  cyber  vulnerabilities  of  its  own \\ncritical assets through its Mission Assurance Program – for many key assets, DoD has identified \\nits  physical  network  infrastructure  on  which  key  physical  assets  depend  –  but  more  must  be \\ndone to secure DoD’s cyber infrastructure. \\n \\nIn addition to destructive and disruptive attacks, cyber actors steal operational information and \\nintellectual property from a range of U.S. government and commercial entities that impact the \\nDefense  Department.  Victims  include  weapons  developers  as  well  as  commercial  firms  that \\nsupport  force  movements  through  U.S.  Transportation  Command  (USTRANSCOM).  State \\nactors  have  stolen  DoD’s  intellectual  property  to  undercut  the  United  States’  strategic  and \\ntechnological advantage and to benefit their own military and economic development. \\n\\nFinally, the Defense Department faces a risk from the  U.S. government’s continued budgetary \\nuncertainty.  Although DoD has prioritized the allocation of resources in its budget to develop \\ncyber  capabilities,  continued  fiscal  uncertainty  requires  that  DoD  plan  to  build  its  cyber \\ncapabilities under a declining overall defense budget. DoD must continue to prioritize its cyber \\ninvestments  and  develop  the  capabilities  required  to  defend  U.S.  interests  at  home  and \\noverseas.  \\n\\nDeterrence in the Future Security Environment  \\n\\nIn  the  face  of  an  escalating  threat,  the  Department  of  Defense  must  contribute  to  the \\ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  cyber  deterrence  strategy  to  deter  key \\nstate  and  non-state  actors  from  conducting  cyberattacks  against  U.S.  interests.  Because  of  the \\nvariety  and  number  of  state  and  non-state  cyber  actors  in  cyberspace  and  the  relative \\navailability  of  destructive  cyber  tools,  an  effective  deterrence  strategy  requires  a  range  of \\npolicies and capabilities to affect a state or non-state actors’ behavior. \\n\\nAs  DoD  builds  its  Cyber  Mission  Force  and  overall  capabilities,  DoD  assumes  that  the \\ndeterrence  of  cyberattacks  on  U.S.  interests  will  not  be  achieved  through  the  articulation  of \\ncyber  policies  alone,  but  through  the  totality  of  U.S.  actions,  including  declaratory  policy, \\nsubstantial  indications  and  warning  capabilities,  defensive  posture,  effective  response \\nprocedures, and the overall resiliency of U.S. networks and systems. The deterrence of state and \\nnon-state  groups  in  cyberspace  will  thus  require  the  focused  attention  of  multiple  U.S. \\ngovernment  departments  and  agencies.  The  Department  of  Defense  has  a  number  of  specific \\nroles to play in this equation.  \\n\\n \\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nDeterrence  is  partially  a  function  of  perception.  It  works  by  convincing  a  potential  adversary \\nthat  it  will  suffer  unacceptable  costs  if  it  conducts  an  attack  on  the  United  States,  and  by \\ndecreasing  the  likelihood  that  a  potential  adversary’s  attack  will  succeed.  The  United  States \\nmust  be  able  to  declare  or  display  effective  response  capabilities  to  deter  an  adversary  from \\ninitiating  an  attack;  develop  effective  defensive  capabilities  to  deny  a  potential  attack  from \\nsucceeding; and strengthen the overall resilience of U.S. systems to withstand a potential attack \\nif  it  penetrates  the  United  States’  defenses.  In  addition,  the  United  States  requires  strong \\nintelligence,  forensics,  and  indications  and  warning  capabilities  to  reduce  anonymity  in \\ncyberspace and increase confidence in attribution. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Response: The United States has been clear that it will respond to a cyberattack on U.S. \\ninterests  through  its  defense  capabilities.  The  United  States  has  articulated  this \\ndeclaratory  policy  in  the  2011  United  States International  Strategy  for  Cyberspace,  in  the \\nDepartment  of  Defense  Cyberspace  Policy  Report  to  Congress  of  2011,  and  through \\npublic statements by the President and the Secretary of Defense.  The United States will \\ncontinue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a \\nplace  of  our  choosing,  using  appropriate  instruments  of U.S.  power  and  in  accordance \\nwith applicable law.   \\n\\n \\n\\uf0b7  Denial: While DoD has made progress in \\nbuilding  the  Cyber  Mission  Force,  DoD \\nmust increase its defensive capabilities to \\ndefend  DoD  networks  and  defend  the \\nnation  from  sophisticated  cyberattacks, \\nand  must  work  with  other  departments, \\nagencies, \\nand \\npartners,  and \\nto \\nstrengthen  deterrence  by  denial  through \\nimproved cybersecurity.  \\n\\nthe  private  sector \\n\\ninternational \\n\\nallies \\n\\n \\n\\uf0b7  Resilience: \\n\\nBecause \\n\\nthat \\n\\nguarantee \\n\\ncapabilities \\n\\nthe  Defense \\ncannot \\nDepartment’s \\nnecessarily \\nevery \\ncyberattack  will  be  denied  successfully, \\nthe  Defense  Department  must  invest  in \\nresilient and redundant systems so that it \\nmay continue its operations in the face of \\ndisruptive  or  destructive  cyberattacks  on  DoD  networks.  The  Defense  Department \\ncannot,  however,  foster  resilience  in  organizations  that  fall  outside  of  its  authority.  In \\norder  for  resilience  to  succeed  as  a  factor  in  effective  deterrence,  other  agencies  of  the \\ngovernment must work with critical infrastructure owners and operators and the private \\nsector  more  broadly  to  develop  resilient  and  redundant  systems  that  can  withstand  a \\npotential attack. Effective resilience measures can help convince potential adversaries of \\nthe futility of commencing cyberattacks on U.S. networks and systems.   \\n\\nAirman  1st  Class  Nate  Hammond  adjusts  the  frequency  of  a  Roll-On \\nBeyond  Line  of  Sight  Enhancement,  or  ROBE,  data  link  system  at  the \\nTransit Center  at  Manas,  Kyrgyzstan.

On  matters  of intelligence, attribution, \\nand  warning,  DoD  and  the  intelligence  community  have  invested  significantly  in  all  source \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\ncollection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state \\nand  non-state  actor  activity  in  cyberspace.  Intelligence  and  attribution  capabilities  help  to \\nunmask  an  actor’s  cyber  persona,  identify  the  attack’s  point  of  origin,  and  determine  tactics, \\ntechniques, and procedures.  Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to \\nconduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.  \\n\\nPublic  and  private  attribution  can  play  a  significant  role  in  dissuading  cyber  actors  from \\nconducting  attacks  in  the  first  place.  The  Defense  Department  will  continue  to  collaborate \\nclosely  with  the  private  sector  and  other  agencies  of  the  U.S.  government  to  strengthen \\nattribution.  This  work  will  be  especially  important  for  deterrence  as  activist  groups,  criminal \\norganizations, and other actors acquire advanced cyber capabilities over time.  \\n\\nFinally,  cyber  capabilities  present  state  and  non-state  actors  with  the  ability  to  strike  at  U.S. \\ninterests in a manner that may or may not necessarily warrant a purely military response by the \\nUnited States, but which  may nonetheless  present a significant threat to U.S. national  security \\nand  may  warrant  a  non-military  response  of  some  kind.  In  response  to  certain  attacks  and \\nintrusions, the United States  may undertake diplomatic actions, take law enforcement actions, \\nand consider economic sanctions.  \\n\\nFor example, the United States used verifiable and attributable data to engage China about the \\nrisks posed by its economic espionage.

The  Defense  Department  will  support  the \\nJustice Department and other agencies in exploring new tools and capabilities to help deter such \\nactivity in cyberspace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\n \\n\\nIII. STRATEGIC GOALS \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTo mitigate risks and defend U.S. interests in the current and future security environment, the \\nDefense  Department  outlines  five  strategic  goals  and  specific  objectives  for  its  activities  and \\nmissions.  \\n \\nSTRATEGIC  GOAL I:  BUILD  AND  MAINTAIN  READY  FORCES  AND  CAPABILITIES \\nTO CONDUCT CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS. \\n \\nTo operate effectively in cyberspace, DoD requires forces and personnel that are trained to the \\nhighest  standard,  ready,  and  equipped  with  best-in-class  technical  capabilities.  In  2013  DoD \\ninitiated a major investment in its cyber personnel and technologies by initiating the CMF; now \\nDoD must make good on that investment by training its people, building effective organizations \\nand command and control systems, and fully developing the capabilities that DoD requires to \\noperate in cyberspace. This strategy sets specific objectives for DoD to meet as it mans, trains, \\nand equips its forces and personnel over the next five years and beyond. \\n \\nSTRATEGIC  GOAL  II:  DEFEND  THE  DOD  INFORMATION  NETWORK,  SECURE \\nDOD DATA, AND MITIGATE RISKS TO DOD MISSIONS.  \\n \\nWhile DoD cannot defend every network and system against every kind of intrusion – DoD’s \\ntotal  network  attack  surface  is  too  large  to  defend  against  all  threats  and  too  vast  to  close  all \\nvulnerabilities  –  DoD  must  take  steps  to  identify,  prioritize,  and  defend  its  most  important \\nnetworks  and  data  so  that  it  can  carry  out  its  missions  effectively.  DoD  must  also  plan  and \\nexercise  to  operate  within  a  degraded  and  disrupted  cyber  environment  in  the  event  that  an \\nattack on DoD’s networks and data succeeds, or if aspects of the critical infrastructure on which \\nDoD relies for its operational and contingency plans are disrupted.   \\n \\nFinally,  DoD  must  raise  the  bar  on  technology  and  innovation  to  stay  ahead  of  the  threat  by \\nenhancing  its  cyber  defense  capabilities,  including  by  building  and  employing  a  more \\ndefendable  network  architecture  in  the  Joint  Information  Environment  (JIE).  Outside  of  DoD \\nnetworks, DoD must work with the private sector to help  secure defense industrial base trade \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\ndata,  and  be  prepared  to  assist  other  agencies  in  hardening  U.S.  networks  and  data  against \\ncyberattacks and cyber espionage.  \\n \\nSTRATEGIC GOAL III: BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE U.S. HOMELAND AND U.S. \\nVITAL  INTERESTS  FROM  DISRUPTIVE  OR  DESTRUCTIVE  CYBERATTACKS  OF \\nSIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE. \\n \\n\\nand  U.S. \\n\\nThe  Department  of  Defense  must  work  with  its \\ninteragency  partners,  the  private  sector,  and  allied \\nand partner nations to deter and if necessary defeat a \\ncyberattack  of  significant  consequence  on  the  U.S. \\nhomeland \\ninterests.  The  Defense \\nDepartment  must  develop  its  intelligence,  warning, \\nand operational capabilities to mitigate sophisticated, \\nmalicious  cyberattacks  before  they  can  impact  U.S. \\ninterests.  Consistent  with  all  applicable  laws  and \\npolicies, DoD requires granular, detailed, predictive, \\nand  actionable  intelligence  about  global  networks \\nand  systems,  adversary  capabilities,  and  malware \\nbrokers  and  markets.  To  defend  the  nation,  DoD \\nmust  build  partnerships  with  other  agencies  of  the \\ngovernment  to  prepare  to  conduct  combined  cyber \\noperations to deter and if necessary defeat aggression \\nin cyberspace. The Defense Department is focused on \\nbuilding \\nthe  capabilities,  processes,  and  plans \\nnecessary to succeed in this mission.  \\n\\nCyber Flag 14-1 participants analyze an exercise scenario in the Red \\nFlag  building  at  Nellis  Air  Force  Base,  NV.

If directed, DoD should be able to \\nuse cyber operations to disrupt an adversary’s command and control networks, military-related \\ncritical infrastructure, and weapons capabilities. As a part of the full range of tools available to \\nthe  United  States,  DoD  must  develop  viable  cyber  options  and  integrate  those  options  into \\nDepartmental plans. DoD will develop cyber capabilities to achieve key security objectives with \\nprecision,  and  to  minimize  loss  of  life  and  destruction  of  property.  To  ensure  unity  of  effort, \\nDoD  will  enable  combatant  commands  to  plan  and  synchronize  cyber  operations with  kinetic \\noperations across all domains of military operations. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nSTRATEGIC  GOAL  V:  BUILD  AND  MAINTAIN  ROBUST  INTERNATIONAL \\nALLIANCES  AND  PARTNERSHIPS  TO  DETER  SHARED  THREATS  AND  INCREASE \\nINTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND STABILITY. \\n \\nAll three of DoD’s cyber missions require close collaboration with foreign allies and partners. In \\nits  international  cyber  engagement  DoD  seeks  to  build  partnership  capacity  in  cybersecurity \\nand cyber defense, and to deepen operational partnerships where appropriate.  \\n \\nGiven  the  high  demand  and  relative  scarcity  of  cyber  resources,  the  Department  of  Defense \\nmust make hard choices and focus its partnership capacity initiatives on areas where vital U.S. \\nnational  interests  are  stake.  Over  the  next  five  years,  in  addition  to  ongoing  partner  capacity \\nbuilding  efforts  in  other  regions,  DoD  will  focus  its  international  engagement  on:  the  Middle \\nEast,  the  Asia-Pacific,  and  key  NATO  allies.  Through  the  course  of  this  strategy  DoD  will \\nconstantly  assess  the  international  environment  and  develop  innovative  partnerships  to \\nrespond to emerging challenges and opportunities.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\x0cT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTHIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n16 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEach  of  DoD’s  strategic  goals  requires  specific,  measurable  objectives  for  the  Department  to \\nachieve. The Office of the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Office of the \\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Joint Staff will \\nwork with DoD components to prioritize and oversee the implementation of this strategy and \\nits  objectives  and  to  assign  offices  of  primary  and  support  responsibility  for  managing  each \\nobjective. The office of primary responsibility will develop a project plan for each objective; the \\nPrincipal  Cyber  Advisor  will  track  progress  in  achieving  each  objective  and  ultimately  the \\nsuccess of each strategic goal.  \\n \\nSTRATEGIC  GOAL I:  BUILD  AND  MAINTAIN  READY  FORCES  AND  CAPABILITIES \\nTO CONDUCT CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS. \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Build  the  cyber  workforce.  To  make  good  on  DoD’s  significant  investment  in  cyber \\npersonnel, and to help achieve many of the objectives in this strategy, DoD’s first priority is \\nto  develop  a  ready  Cyber  Mission  Force  and  associated  cyber  workforce.  This  workforce \\nwill be built on three foundational pillars: enhanced training; improved military and civilian \\nrecruitment and retention; and stronger private sector support.  \\n\\n \\n\\no  Maintain a persistent training environment. DoD requires an individual and collective \\ntraining  capability  to  achieve  the  goals  outlined  in  this  strategy  and  to  meet  future \\noperational  requirements.  U.S.  Cyber  Command  will  work  with  other  components, \\nagencies, and military departments to define the requirements for and create a training \\nenvironment  that  will  enable  the  total  cyber  force  to  conduct  joint  training  (including \\nexercises  and  mission  rehearsals),  experimentation,  certification,  as  well  as  the \\nassessment  and  development  of  cyber  capabilities  and  tactics,  techniques,  and \\nprocedures for missions that cross boundaries and networks.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n\\n\\x0cT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\no  Build  viable  career  paths.  Throughout  the  course  of  this  strategy,  and  following  the \\nCMF  decisions  of  2013,  DoD  will  continue  to  foster  viable  career  paths  for  all  military \\npersonnel performing and supporting cyber operations.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\no  Draw on the National Guard and Reserve. Throughout the course of this strategy, DoD \\nwill  draw  on  the  National  Guard  and  Reserve  Components  as  a  resource  for  expertise \\nand  to  foster  creative  solutions  to  cybersecurity  problems.  The  Reserve  Component \\noffers a unique capability for supporting each of DoD’s missions, including for engaging \\nthe defense industrial base and the commercial sector. It represents DoD’s critical surge \\ncapacity for cyber responders.  \\n\\n \\no  Improve  civilian  recruitment  and  retention.  In  addition  to  developing  highly-skilled \\nmilitary  personnel,  DoD  must  recruit  and  retain  highly-skilled  civilian  personnel, \\nincluding technical personnel for its total cyber workforce. Civilians must follow a well-\\ndeveloped  career  development  and  advancement  track  and  be  provided  with  best-in-\\nclass opportunities to develop and succeed within the workforce.    \\n \\n\\no  Develop  and  implement  exchange  programs  with  the  private  sector.  To  supplement \\nDoD’s  civilian  cyber  workforce,  DoD  must  be  able  to  employ  technical  subject  matter \\nexperts  from  the  best  cybersecurity  and  information  technology  companies  in  the \\ncountry  to  perform  unique  engineering  and  analytic  roles  within  DoD.  The  Defense \\nDepartment  will  implement  successful  private  sector  exchange  programs  to  bring \\nmeasurable benefits to the Department of Defense through the design and development \\nof new operational concepts for DoD’s cyberspace missions.  \\n \\n\\no  Support the National Initiative for Cyberspace Education. DoD will develop policies to \\nsupport the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education. Working with interagency \\npartners,  one  or  more  educational  institutions,  as  well  as  state  and  private  sector \\npartners, DoD will continue to support innovative workforce development partnerships \\nfocused on both the technical and policy dimensions of cybersecurity and cyber defense.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Build  technical  capabilities  for  cyber  operations.  In  2013,  DoD  developed  a  model  for \\nachieving CMF readiness and for developing viable cyber military options to present to the \\nPresident and Secretary of Defense. DoD must have the technical tools available to conduct \\noperations  in  support  of  combatant  command  missions.  Key  initiatives  include  the \\nfollowing: \\n\\n \\n\\no  Develop  the  Unified  Platform.    On  the  basis  of  planning  requirements,  DoD  will \\ndevelop  the  detailed  requirements  for  integrating  disparate  cyber  platforms  and \\nbuilding  an  interoperable  and  extendable  network  of  cyber  capabilities.  This  Unified \\nPlatform will enable the CMF to conduct full-spectrum cyberspace operations in support \\nof national requirements.  \\n\\n \\no  Accelerate  research  and  development.  The  Defense  Department  will  continue  to \\naccelerate  innovative  cyber  research  and  development  to  build  cyber  capabilities.  The \\n\\n \\n\\n18 \\n\\n\\x0cT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nDoD research and development community as well as established and emerging private \\nsector  partners  can  provide  DoD  and  the  nation  with  a  significant  advantage  in \\ndeveloping leap-ahead technologies to defend U.S. interests in cyberspace. In addition to \\nsupporting  current  and  planned  investments,  DoD  will  focus  its  basic  and  applied \\nresearch agenda on developing cyber capabilities to expand the capacity of the CMF and \\nthe broader DoD cyber workforce.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Validate and continually refine  an adaptive command and control mechanism for  cyber \\noperations. DoD has made significant progress in recent years in developing command and \\ncontrol for all three of its missions, but its command and control model must be finalized, \\nresourced,  and  tested  to  ensure  effectiveness.  The  command  and  control  model  must \\nsupport  USCYBERCOM  and  the  combatant commands.    It  must be  efficient  and  practical, \\nand must promote unity of effort of effort across all three cyber missions.  \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Establish an enterprise-wide cyber modeling and simulation capability. DoD will work in \\ncollaboration  with  the  intelligence  community  to  develop  the  data  schema,  databases, \\nalgorithms,  and  modeling  and  simulation  (M&S)  capabilities  necessary  to  assess  the \\neffectiveness of cyber operations.  \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Assess  Cyber  Mission  Force  capacity. \\nAssess  the  capacity  of  the  projected  Cyber \\nMission  Force \\nits  mission \\nobjectives  when  confronted  with  multiple \\ncontingencies.  \\n \\no  The \\n\\nJoint  Staff,  with  support \\n\\nto  achieve \\n\\nthe \\n\\nto \\n\\nand \\n\\nfrom \\nother  DoD \\nUSCYBERCOM \\ncollect, \\ncomponents,  will  propose, \\nanalyze,  and  report  a  set  of  appropriate \\nmetrics to the Principal Cyber Advisor to \\nmeasure  the  operational  capacity  of  the \\nCMF. These metrics will include updates \\nof  USCYBERCOM \\non \\ncontingency \\ninclude \\ncapability  development  and  proficiency  as  well  as  accesses  and  tools  that  may  be \\nrequired  in  a  contingency.  In  response  to  this  analysis,  DoD  will  develop  a  plan  for \\nensuring that the CMF has the appropriate capacity and flexibility available to respond \\nto changes in the strategic environment.  \\n\\nAir  Force  Tech  Sgt.

The single security architecture will adapt and evolve to mitigate cyber threats; \\nit  will  help  DoD  to  develop  and  follow  best-in-class  cybersecurity  practices,  and  its  small \\nnetwork footprint will allow USCYBERCOM, combatant commands, and DoD components \\nto maintain comprehensive situational awareness of network threats and mitigations.  \\n\\n \\n\\no  The JIE’s single security architecture will enable a robust network defense and shift the \\nfocus  from  protecting  service-specific  networks  and  systems  to  securing  the  DoD \\nenterprise in a unified manner. The JIE’s single security architecture must be developed \\nwith  enhanced  cyber  situational  awareness,  deployed  in  response  to  validated \\nrequirements, and able to accommodate future defensive measures.  \\n \\n\\no  As a part of JIE planning DoD will develop a framework for developing and integrating \\nnew  defensive  techniques  into  DoD’s  cybersecurity  architecture,  to  include  anomaly-\\nbased  detection  capabilities,  data  analytics  to  identify  vulnerabilities  and  threats,  and \\nadvanced encryption methods.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(DoDIN)  operations.  Operating  under  USCYBERCOM, \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Assess and ensure the effectiveness of the Joint Force Headquarters for DoD information \\nJoint  Force \\nnetwork \\nHeadquarters-DoDIN  will  coordinate  network  defense  and  mitigate  cyber  risks  to  DoD \\noperations and missions across the defense enterprise.  DoD will assess, validate, and fully \\nimplement the Joint Force Headquarters-DoDIN concept to operate DoD networks securely, \\ndefend DoD networks, and mitigate cyber risks to DoD missions.  \\n\\nthe \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Mitigate  known  vulnerabilities.  The  Defense  Department  will  implement  a  capability  to \\nmitigate  all  known  vulnerabilities  that  present  a  high  risk  to  DoD  networks  and  data.  In \\naddition  to  zero-day  vulnerabilities,  one  of  the  greatest  threats  to  DoD  networks  and \\nsystems lies in known, high-risk vulnerabilities that potential adversaries can exploit. DoD \\noften finds itself rushing to close vulnerabilities once an adversary has penetrated a system. \\nThe  DoD  Chief  Information  Officer  (CIO)  will  lead  an  effort  to  implement  an  automated \\npatch management capability to distribute software and configuration patches, updates, and \\nfixes to mitigate known, major vulnerabilities on DoD networks and systems against threats.  \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Assess DoD’s cyber defense forces.  The Defense Department will assess its cyber defense \\nforces’  ability  to  conduct  integrated,  adaptive,  and  dynamic  defensive  operations. \\nEnterprise-level  and  Cyber  Protection  Team  (CPT)  network  defenders  must  be  able  to \\ndiscover,  detect,  analyze,  and  mitigate  threats  and  vulnerabilities  to  defend  the  DoD \\ninformation network.  \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nImprove  the  effectiveness  of  the  current  DoD  Computer  Network  Defense  Service \\nProvider  (CNDSP)  construct  in  defending  and  protecting  DoD  networks.  Computer \\nnetwork  defense  service  providers  deliver  cybersecurity  solutions  for  DoD  networks,  to \\ninclude  monitoring,  detection,  and  protection  capabilities.  The  Defense  Department  will \\ndetermine  whether  current  CNDSP  processes  are  sufficient  to  defend  networks  against \\nknown  and  projected  threats  in  cyberspace  and  whether  current  CNDSP  forces  are \\nadequately  trained  and  equipped  to  defend  against  advanced  threats.  Finally,  DoD  will \\n\\n \\n\\n20 \\n\\n\\x0cT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\ndetermine  whether  its  CNDSP  forces  can  integrate  into  the  broader  cyberspace  command \\nand  control  construct  and  how  that  integrated  construct  will  perform  in  the  face  of  cyber \\nthreats that span CNDSP and CPT protected networks and data.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Plan for network defense and resilience. The Defense Department must identify and plan \\nto  defend  the  networks  that  support  key  DoD  missions.  The  Department  must  make  a \\ncareful  assessment  of  the  priority  assets  that  it  must  defend  in  cyberspace  to  assure  DoD \\nmissions and exercise to defend those assets effectively. \\n \\no  Integrate  cyber  into  mission  assurance  assessments.  The  Defense  Department  will \\nintegrate cybersecurity requirements and assessments into the DoD Mission Assurance \\nprogram  and  update  DoD  policy  appropriately.  Currently  DoD  components  take \\nvarying  approaches  to  measuring  and \\nassessing \\nfor  mission \\nassurance.  DoD  will  develop  a  Joint \\nMission  Assurance  Assessment  Program \\nthat \\nof \\ncybersecurity  assessments,  cybersecurity \\nrequirements,  and  cyber  operations’ \\nrequirements.  \\n \\n\\nintegration \\n\\nincludes \\n\\ncyber \\n\\nrisks \\n\\nthe \\n\\no  Assess  Cyber  Protection  Team  (CPT) \\ncapabilities.  DoD  will  complete  an \\nassessment  of  CPT  capacity,  capability, \\nand  employment  model  in  regard  to \\nmission  assurance  priorities  as  set  by \\ncombatant command requirements. \\n\\nSoldiers monitor networks in the Cyber Mission Unit Operations Center at \\nthe  Army's  Cyber  Center  of  Excellence,  Fort  Gordon,  GA.  (Photo  by \\nMichael L. Lewis) \\n\\n \\no  Improve weapons systems cybersecurity. DoD will assess and initiate improvements to \\nthe  cybersecurity  of  current  and  future  weapons  systems,  doing  so  on  the  basis  of \\noperational  requirements.  For  all  future  weapons  systems  that  DoD  will  acquire  or \\nprocure,  DoD  will  mandate  specific  cybersecurity  standards  for  weapons  systems  to \\nmeet.  Acquisition  and  procurement  policy  and  practice  will  be  updated  to  promote \\neffective cybersecurity throughout a system’s life cycle.  \\n \\n\\no  Build  and  exercise  continuity  plans.  All  DoD  components  will  identify  and  build \\nresiliency  plans  to  maintain  continuity  of  their  most  critical  operations  in  the  event  of \\nnetwork  disruption  and  degradation.  Military  campaign  plans  must  fully  incorporate \\nthe ability to operate in a degraded cyber environment; military forces must exercise and \\nbe able to conduct military campaigns in a degraded cyber environment where access to \\nnetworks  and  data  is  uncertain.  Components  must  balance  cyber  risks  effectively  to \\nensure that they can continue to carry out their missions in the physical world.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Red  team  DoD’s  network  defenses.  The  Defense  Department  has  developed  mature  red \\nteam capabilities to test vital networks and mission systems for vulnerabilities and to better \\n\\n \\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nprepare its cyber defense forces. Going forward, DoD must focus its red team capabilities on \\npriority networks and mission systems to assure DoD’s ability to carry out its most critical \\nmissions. As a part of this work, every major DoD exercise should include a cyber red team \\nto  test  DoD's  cyber  defenses  in  a  realistic  scenario  where  the  Department  could  have  its \\noperations  disrupted  by  an  adversary.  Components  will  be  audited  regularly  to  ensure \\nprogress in incorporating red team findings and improving their cybersecurity posture. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Mitigate the risk of insider threats. The nation's defense depends upon the fidelity of those \\nentrusted  with  the  nation's  secrets.  The  Defense  Department  has  invested  in  the \\ntechnological  and  personnel  solutions  necessary  to  identify  threats  before  they  can  impact \\nU.S.  national  security.  The  Defense  Department  continues  to  deploy  and  implement  these \\nsolutions through continuous network monitoring, improved cybersecurity training for the \\nworkforce,  and  improved  methods  for  identifying\\u200e,  reporting,  and  tracking  suspicious \\nbehavior. \\n\\n \\n\\no  This  work  extends  beyond  information  technology  and  includes  matters  of  personnel \\nand reliability. Mitigating the insider threat requires good leadership and accountability \\nthroughout  the  workforce.  Beyond  implementing  policies  and  protocols,  leaders  will \\nstrive  to  create  a  culture  of  awareness  to  anticipate,  detect,  and  respond  to  insider \\nthreats before they have an impact. \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Exercise to provide Defense Support of Civil Authorities. Under its existing and planned \\nforce  structure,  DoD  will  develop  a  framework  and  exercise  its  Defense  Support  of  Civil \\nAuthorities  (DSCA)  capabilities  in  support  of  DHS  and  other  agencies  and  with  state  and \\nlocal  authorities  to  help  defend  the  federal  government  and  the  private  sector  in  an \\nemergency if directed.  \\n\\n \\n\\no  DoD‘s  annual  exercise  program,  to  include  Cyber  Guard,  will  include  exercising  with \\nDHS  and  the  FBI  for  contingencies  that  may  require  emergency  allocation  of  forces  to \\nhelp  protect  critical \\ninfrastructure,  under \\npartner  agencies’  lead.

To defend \\nthe nation against cyberattacks of significant consequence, DoD will work with the broader \\nintelligence  community  to  develop  intelligence  capabilities  about  adversary  activities  and \\nprepare to disrupt cyberattacks before they can impact the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests. \\nTo meet combatant command contingency requirements, DoD will expand its intelligence of \\nkey  adversary  human  and  technical  networks.  To  operate  effectively  in  cyberspace  DoD \\nrequires  cyber  intelligence  and  warning  and  shared  situational  awareness  through  all \\nphases of a potential operation. All intelligence collection will follow the law and guidance \\noutlined in executive orders. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Develop  and  exercise  capabilities  to  defend  the  nation.

The  Defense  Department’s \\nrequirements  and  capabilities  for \\nits \\nmission  to  defend  the  nation  against \\ncyberattacks  of  significant  consequence \\nwill evolve over time. On an annual basis, DoD will conduct an in-depth review of the \\ncapabilities  available  and  required  for  the  mission.  As  a  part  of  this  review,  DoD  will \\nvalidate new requirements and identify gaps and initiatives to pursue.  \\n\\nThe  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA)  Plan  X \\nprogram  is  a  foundational  cyber  warfare  program  that  is  developing \\nplatforms for the Defense Department.

DoD  will work \\nwith  DHS  to  improve  the  Enhanced  Cybersecurity  Services  program  and  encourage \\nadditional  critical  infrastructure  entities  to  participate,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on \\nincreasing the number of defense critical infrastructure participants.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Develop  automated  information  sharing  tools.  To  improve  shared  situational  awareness \\nDoD  will  partner  with  DHS  and  other  agencies  to  develop  continuous,  automated, \\nstandardized  mechanisms  for  sharing  information  with  each  of  its  critical  partners  in  the \\nU.S.  government,  key  allied  and  partner  militaries,  state  and  local  governments,  and  the \\nprivate  sector.  In  addition,  DoD  will  work  with  other  U.S.  government  agencies  and \\nCongress  to  support  legislation  that  enables  information  sharing  between  the  U.S. \\ngovernment and the private sector.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Assess DoD’s  cyber  deterrence  posture  and  strategy.  Building off of the Defense Science \\nBoard’s  Task  Force  on  Cyber  Deterrence,  U.S.  Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM),  in \\ncoordination with the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, will assess the \\nDepartment of Defense’s ability to deter specific state and non-state actors from conducting \\ncyberattacks of significant consequence on the U.S. homeland and against U.S. interests, to \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\ninclude loss of life, significant destruction of property, or significant impact on U.S. foreign \\nand economic policy interests.   \\n\\n \\n\\no \\n\\nIn conducting its analysis, USSTRATCOM must determine whether DoD is building the \\ncapabilities  required  for  attributing  and  deterring  key  threats  from  conducting  such \\nattacks  and  recommend  specific  actions  that  DoD  can  take  to  improve  its  cyber \\ndeterrence  posture.   Careful  attention  should  be  devoted  also  to  deterring  non-state \\nactors that may fall outside of traditional deterrence frameworks but which could pose a \\nconsiderable threat to U.S. interests. \\n\\n \\nSTRATEGIC  GOAL  IV:  BUILD  AND  MAINTAIN  VIABLE  CYBER  OPTIONS  AND \\nPLAN  TO  USE  THOSE  OPTIONS  TO  CONTROL  CONFLICT  ESCALATION  AND  TO \\nSHAPE THE CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT AT ALL STAGES.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nIntegrate cyber options into plans. To meet strategic end-states as defined by the Guidance \\nfor the Employment of the Force, combatant command plans, and other strategic guidance \\ndocuments, DoD will work with agencies of the U.S. government as well as U.S. allies and \\npartners to integrate cyber options into combatant command planning.  \\n\\n \\n\\no  Accelerate  the  integration  of  cyber  requirements  into  plans.  The  Defense  Department \\nwill  accelerate  the  integration  of  cyber  requirements  into  combatant  command  plans. \\nPlans must outline and define specific cyberspace effects against targets. To facilitate this \\nwork,  the  Joint  Staff  will  work  with  USSTRATCOM  to  synchronize  and  integrate \\nrequirements into planning and provide recommendations to the Chairman of the Joint \\nChiefs  of  Staff  on  the  alignment,  allocation,  assignment,  and  apportionment  of  Cyber \\nMission Forces.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSTRATEGIC  GOAL  V:  BUILD  AND  MAINTAIN  ROBUST  INTERNATIONAL \\nALLIANCES  AND  PARTNERSHIPS  TO  DETER  SHARED  THREATS  AND  INCREASE \\nINTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND STABILITY. \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Build partner capacity in key regions. Under its existing and planned force structure, DoD \\nwill work with key allies and partners to build partner capacity and help secure the critical \\ninfrastructure  and  key  resources  on  which  DoD  missions  and  U.S.  interests  depend.    The \\nDefense  Department  will  work  regularly  with  other  agencies  of  the  U.S.  government,  to \\ninclude  the  Department  of  State,  in  building  partner  capacity.  Priority  regions  include  the \\nMiddle East, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. \\n\\n \\n\\no  Support  the  hardening  and  resiliency  of  Middle Eastern  allies’  and  partners’  networks \\nand systems. As a part of its cyber dialogue and partnerships, DoD will work with key \\nMiddle  Eastern  allies  and  partners  to  improve  their  ability  to  secure  their  military \\nnetworks  as  well  as  the  critical  infrastructure  and  key  resources  upon  which  U.S. \\ninterests  depend.  Key  initiatives  include  improved  information  sharing  to  establish  a \\n\\n \\n\\n26 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nunified  understanding  of  the  cyber  threat,  an  assessment  of  our  mutual  cyber  defense \\nposture, and collaborative approaches to building cyber expertise.  \\n\\n  \\n\\no  Support  the  hardening  and  resiliency  of \\nNortheast  Asian  allies’  networks  and \\nsystems.  As  a  part  of  its  broader  cyber \\ndialogue with Asian allies, DoD will work \\nwith  key  allies  and  partners  to  improve \\ntheir  ability  to  secure  their  military \\nnetworks  and  critical  infrastructure  and \\nkey resources upon which U.S. and allied \\ninterests depend.  \\n\\n \\n\\nregion. \\n\\no  Build  new  strategic  partnerships  in  the \\nAsia-Pacific \\nThe  Defense \\nDepartment  will  work  with  key  states \\nacross  the  Asia-Pacific  to  build  cyber \\ncapacity  and  minimize  risk  to  U.S.  and \\nallied  interests,  in  a  manner  consistent \\nwith  DoD’s \\nInternational  Cyberspace \\nSecurity Cooperation Guidance. \\n\\n \\n\\nU.S.  Navy  Seaman  Katelynn  L.

State and non-state \\nactors seek to acquire destructive malware. The uncontrolled spread of destructive malware \\nto  hostile  actors  presents  a  significant  risk  to  the  international  system.  Working  with  the \\nDepartment  of  State  and  other  agencies  of  the  U.S.  government  as  well  as  U.S.  allies  and \\npartners, the Defense Department will draw on best-practices to counter the proliferation of \\ndestructive  malware  within  the  international  system.    In  addition  to  international  regimes \\nand best-practices, the U.S. government has a range of domestic export control regimes for \\ngoverning dual-use technologies that can be used to prevent proliferation.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Work  with  capable  international  partners  to  plan  and  train  for  cyber  operations. \\nThroughout  the course of  this  strategy, DoD will  strengthen  its  international  alliances  and \\npartnerships  to  develop  combined  capabilities  to  achieve  cyber  effects  in  support  of \\ncombatant command plans.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n27 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Strengthen  the  United  States  cyber  dialogue  with  China  to  enhance  strategic  stability. \\nThrough  the  course  of  this  strategy,  as  part  of  the  U.S.-China  Defense  Consultative  Talks \\nand  related  dialogues,  such  as  the  Cyber  Working  Group,  DoD  will  continue  to  hold \\ndiscussions  with  China  to  bring  greater  understanding  and  transparency  of  each  nation’s \\nmilitary doctrine, policy, roles and missions in cyberspace. The goal of this work is to reduce \\nthe  risks  of  misperception  and  miscalculation  that  could  contribute  to  escalation  and \\ninstability.  DoD  will  support  U.S.  government  efforts  to  strengthen  confidence-building \\nmeasures  to  bring  a  greater  level  of  trust  to  the  U.S.-China  relationship.  In  addition,  DoD \\nwill  continue  to  raise  concerns  about  China’s  cyber  enabled  theft  of  U.S.  intellectual \\nproperty, trade secrets, and confidential business information.1  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1 If and when U.S.-Russia military relations resume, as a part of broader interagency efforts DoD will seek \\nto develop a military-to-military cyber dialogue with Russia to foster strategic stability in cyberspace.  \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\n \\n\\nV. MANAGING THE STRATEGY  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTo achieve the goals and objectives outlined in this strategy will require hard choices regarding \\ncyber  forces  and  personnel,  organizations,  and  capabilities.  The  financial  choices  that  DoD \\nmakes in the course of implementing this strategy will have national and global implications for \\nyears to come, and DoD must operate in an effective and cost-efficient manner to guarantee the \\nbest  return  on  its  investments.  To  that  end,  DoD  will  pursue  the  following  management \\nobjectives to govern its cyber activities and missions.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Establish  the  Office  of  the  Principal  Cyber  Advisor  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  In  the \\nNational  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA)  of  2014,  Congress  required  the  Defense \\nDepartment  to  designate  a  Principal  Cyber  Advisor  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense  to  review \\nmilitary  cyberspace  activities,  cyber  mission  forces,  and  offensive  and  defensive  cyber \\noperations  and  missions.  In  addition,  the  Principal  Cyber  Advisor  will  govern  the \\ndevelopment of DoD cyberspace policy and strategy for the DoD enterprise.  \\n \\no  The  2014  NDAA  also  stipulated  that  this  Principal  Cyber  Advisor  integrate  the  cyber \\nexpertise  and  perspectives  of  key  organizations  to  build  an  intradepartmental  team  of \\nkey  players  to  ensure  effective  governance  of  cyber  issues  within  DoD.    The  Principal \\nCyber Advisor responsibilities assigned by the FY14 NDAA shall not be interpreted to \\naffect the existing responsibilities and authorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for \\nAcquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics;  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Policy;  the \\nUnder  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Intelligence;  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for \\nPersonnel and Readiness; or any other Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) in the office of the \\nSecretary of Defense in cyber-related responsibilities and authorities. \\n \\n\\no  An  intradepartmental  team.  The  Principal  Cyber  Advisor  will  work  with  DoD \\ncomponents  through  the  Cyber  Investment  and  Management  Board  (CIMB)  to  review \\nDoD’s cyber management. The CIMB will be a forum for synchronization, coordination, \\nand  project  management.  It  will  not  replicate  existing  programmatic  and  budgetary \\nmechanisms  or  interfere  with  previously  defined  Principal  Staff  Assistant  roles  and \\nauthorities, nor will it interfere in any way with the military chain of command; rather, it \\nwill provide a single forum to integrate cyber initiatives, it will manage projects through \\n\\n \\n\\n29 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\ncompletion,  and  streamline  DoD’s  cyber  governance  structures.    The  PCA  will  work \\nwith  the  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and \\nLogistics and the Joint Staff to build an intradepartmental team of DoD representatives \\nto support the CIMB in this work. \\n\\n \\n\\no  A  senior  executive  forum.  Subordinate  and  reporting  to  the  CIMB,  a  senior  executive \\nforum  will  provide  initial  senior-level  coordination  on  key  cyber  issues.    The  senior \\nexecutive forum will recommend courses of action to the CIMB and will coordinate with \\nother  OSD  and  Joint  Staff  governance  bodies  to  facilitate  unity  of  effort  and  resolve \\nmanagement issues at appropriate levels. \\n \\nIf  and  when  a  budgetary  or  financial  matter  comes  into  play  during  the  Program  and \\nBudget Review process, the Principal Cyber Advisor will use the senior executive forum \\nand  the  CIMB  to  coordinate  recommendations  for  the  Deputy’s  Management  Action \\nGroup or other financial and budgetary organizations, vetting options and alternatives \\nthrough the issue teams as appropriate.  \\n \\n\\no \\n\\nImprove cyber budgetary management. DoD will develop an agreed-upon method to more \\ntransparently  and  effectively  manage  the  DoD  cyber  operations  budget.  Today  cyber \\nfunding  is  spread  across  the  DoD  budget,  to  include  the  Military  Intelligence  Program \\n(MIP), in multiple appropriations, budget lines, program elements, and projects. In addition, \\nthe Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, on behalf of DoD, ensures that all National \\nIntelligence  Program  (NIP)  investments  are  aligned  to  support  DoD  missions.  The  diffuse \\nnature  of  the  DoD  cyber  budget  presents  DoD  with  a  challenge  for  effective  budgetary \\nmanagement; DoD must develop a new method for \\nmanaging  cross-program \\nimprove \\nmission  effectiveness  and  achieve  management \\nefficiencies.  \\n\\nfunding \\n\\nto \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Develop  DoD’s  cyber  operations  and \\ncybersecurity  policy  framework.  Consistent  with \\nPresidential  guidance,  DoD  will  align  and  simplify \\nits  cyber  operations  and  cybersecurity  policy \\nmanagement  and  identified  gaps,  overlaps,  seams, \\nconflicts,  and  areas  in  need  of  revision  in  current \\ndocumentation.  This  effort  will  help  translate \\nnational and departmental guidance and policy into \\ntactical  operations.  It  is  essential  to  clarifying \\nconflicts  in  existing  documentation  that  currently \\ncomplicate  cyber  operations  and  cybersecurity \\ngovernance. \\n \\n\\nSailors conduct an exercise at Fleet Cyber Command's headquarters in \\nthe  Frank  B.  Rowlett  Building,  Fort  George  G.  Meade,  MD.  This \\nexercise  features  members  of  Fleet  Cyber  Command's  Joint  Force \\nHeadquarters-Cyber (JFHQ-C). \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Conduct an end-to-end assessment of DoD’s cyber capabilities. U.S. Cyber Command \\nwill  lead  a  comprehensive  operational  assessment  of  its  posture.  In  coordination  with \\nthe  Principal  Cyber  Advisor  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Office  of  the  Under \\nSecretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics,  and  the  Office  of  the \\nDirector  of  Coast  Assessment  and  Program  Evaluation,  USCYBERCOM  will  provide \\nshort- and long-term recommendations through the CIMB to provide to the Secretary of \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cT h e   D e p a r t m e n t   o f   D e f e n s e   C y b e r   S t r a t e g y  \\n\\nDefense regarding organizational structure, command and control mechanism, rules of \\nengagement,  personnel,  capabilities,  tools,  and  potential  operational  gaps.

State and non-state actors threaten \\ndisruptive and destructive attacks against the United States and conduct cyber-enabled theft of \\nintellectual  property  to  undercut  the  United  States’  technological  and  military  advantage.  We \\nare vulnerable in cyberspace, and the scale of the cyber threat requires urgent action by leaders \\nand organizations across the government and the private sector.  \\n\\nSince developing its first cyber strategy in 2011, the Defense Department has made significant \\nprogress in building its cyber capabilities, developing its organizations and plans, and fostering \\nthe  partnerships  necessary  to  defend  the  country  and  its  interests.  More  must  be  done. \\nStemming from the goals and objectives outlined in this strategy, appropriate resources must be \\naligned and managed to ensure progress.  \\n\\nThis strategy presents an aggressive, specific plan for achieving change. For DoD to succeed in \\nits  mission  of  defending  the  United  States  and  its  interests  in  cyberspace,  leaders  from  across \\nthe Department must take action to achieve the objectives outlined in this document. They must \\nalso  hold  their  organizations  accountable.  Because  of  the  nature  of  networks  and  computer \\ncode,  no  single  organization  can  be  relied  upon  to  do  this  work.  Success  requires  close \\ncollaboration across DoD, between agencies of the U.S. government, with the private sector, and \\nwith U.S. allies and partners.  \\n\\nThe strategic environment can change quickly. That is especially true in cyberspace. We must be \\ndynamic,  flexible,  and  agile  in  this  work.  We  must  anticipate  emerging  threats,  identify  new \\ncapabilities to build, and determine how to enhance our partnerships and planning.  As always, \\nour women and men – both uniformed and civilian personnel – will be our greatest and most \\nenduring  strength  and  a  constant  source  of  inspiration.  By  working  together  we  will  help \\nprotect and defend the United States and its interests in the digital age. \\n\\n \\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c\")"

Cyberspace has increasingly become the domain\\nthrough which the citizen’sfandamental liberties of information, expression and association are\\nfulﬁlled, the transparency of public policies is pursued and the efﬁciency of public administrations is\\nstimulated, growth and innovation are attained. In this global virtual arena) billions ofconnections\\nare set everyday across geographical borders) knowledge is shared) and the world as we know it is\\nredesigned at an unprecedented speed.\\n\\nThe securig/ and the prosperity of any Country increasingly) depend on the protection of the I CT\\nnetworks that hast this evergrowing wealth ofknowledge and connections, and it is therefore more\\nand more compelling to ensure in cyberspace the respect of the rights and duties already preserved\\nin the civil society) in the economicfahric of the society) and in the International Community.\\nThe digital arena is not a space outside of the lam and it is our duty to guarantee that also in\\nthis domain the democratic principles anal values in which we believe are uphold and the norms\\npreserving individual libertieg equality andﬁeea’om are saﬁgaarded. Likewise, it is only in an\\nenvironment 0ftmst and mutual respect that it will be possible to fully reap the opportunities of\\ngrowth oﬁrered by digital platforms, and to secure the development of an open, safe and reliable\\ncyberspacefor the heneﬁ t of our ﬁnancial system, our companies and our consumers.\\n\\nThe ever—increasing reliance ofmodern societies on cyberspace implies that the harm occurring\\nin case of a disruption of the ICT inﬂastmctnre or in the event ofattacles carried out throughout\\nthe ICT networks could he dreadful at the least. Threats can stem ﬁom any point of the world\\nwide web, and they often hit the weakest links) such as the most vulnerable individuals and the\\nleast protected computer systems and ICT networks. Appalling crimes are carried out through\\nthe world wide web) such as the exchange ofchild pornography) and online thefts andﬁ\\'ands can\\nseverely damage individual wealth and valuables) hampering the necessary le1/el 0ftmst within\\nthe digital community. Cybercrime is a plague that can cause the bankruptcy of ﬁrms and the\\ntheft of their intellectual property, crippling the wealth of an entire nation. We assist with growing\\nconcern to an increasingly insidious threat that exploits I CT vulnerabilities to stealthily steal the\\nresults ofonr research and development efforts in the ﬁeld of new technologies and products. For\\n\\na conntiy like Italy, which places innovation at the cornerstone of its growth and competitiveness,\\x0c\\nNational strategic framework for cyberspace security\\n\\nthe potential harm is inealenlahle. Given the growing degree ofsophistieation ofcyher attacks\\nand the ever—increasing dependency afowr inﬂastmctares on ICT networks, our very national\\nstahility and security are at risk. It is therefore essential to enmre the ﬁnest possible protection of\\nour critical I C Tassets from attack: that can potentially have devastating eﬁ‘ects) as it would he the\\nease in the event of cyher attack: impeding or mhverting the correctﬁwnctioning of the national\\ntransport system or of energy grids) or even ofoar military Command and Control centers. It is\\ntherefore necessaiy to develop and uphold an innovative defence posture, one that is ahle to engage\\nthe private sector and leverage its skills in the protection of the critical I CT that the latter owns and\\noperates, and that factors the cyher dimension offntnre conﬂicts in its strategic doctrine and in the\\ncapahility planningproeess.\\n\\nNetworks interdependence, the intrinsic asymmetry of the cyher threat, and the pereasiveness\\nofcyherspace in all aspects of everyday life are all features that call for a holistic approach and\\nthe synergic eﬂrorts of all involved stakeholders if we are to ensure an adequate level ofsecmity\\nin cyherspaee. The ultimate ohjectiues must he to strengthen our collective ahility t0 preempt an\\nattack, to detect it while it happens, to react to it, to mitigate its effects, to attribute its origin, and\\nto rapidly restore the originalfnnctionality, while at the same time retaining the lessons learned\\nﬂom the case.\\n\\nAt the international level) Italy isﬁwlly engaged in multilateral institutions, ﬁrst of all within\\nthe E U and NATO, as well as with all 0w hilateral partners, to promote the endorsement and\\nrespect of a set ofrnles of behavior in the digital arena that is consistent with our values, and to\\nfacilitate the emergence of a shared approach to eyherspace governance, so that the International\\nCommunity as a whole can effectively cope with the challenges laying ahead. At the domestic level,\\nit is ofoatmost importance the promotion of a well»caordinated and multidimensional approach\\nin order to prouidefor the convergence ofall Pnhlic Administrations efforts toward the achievement\\nafohjectiues that are matnally reinforcing with those of the private sector and the academia.\\n\\nIn the current ﬁnancial and economic tightening, we cannot allow for any duplication of\\neﬁ‘orts and we must therefore seek any possihle synergy) keeping in mind that the hndget allocation\\nthat will he necessany constitute not only a net saving ifcompared with the possihle damage cyher\\x0c\\nForeword\\n\\nattacks can entail but also an extraordinary opportunity of cultural social and economicgrowth.\\nIn line with what is setforth in the Prime Minister’s Decree of the 24th January 2013, the\\npresent National Cyhersemrity Strategic Framework highlights the nature and the evolving trends\\nof the cyber threat as well as of the vulnerabilities to the national I CT networks) it outlines roles\\nand tasks ofpuhlic and private stakeholders involved in cyhersemrity) and identiﬁes tools and\\nprocedures to enhance the country’s preparedness to conﬂont head—on the new challengesposed by\\ncyberspace. The attached National Plan identiﬁes a limited set of priorities, and provides speciﬁc\\nobjectives andgmdelines in order to give concrete implementation to the Strategic Framework.\\nWith these two documents Italy sets out a strategy around which to coordinate all efforts, :0\\nthat we com ﬁtce with conﬁdence the security threats and challenges stemming from cyberspace,\\n\\nandpwme our national interest where the wealth of nations will more and more prosper.\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n\\nFollowing the adoption of the Prime\\nMinister’s “Decree Containing Strategic\\nCyber\\nProtection and ICF Security” of the\\n\\nGuidelines For the National\\n24th January 2013, the Cybersecurity\\nWorking Group was established on the\\n3rd of April 2013 under the auspices of\\nthe Committee For the Security of the\\nRepublic, chaired by the Department\\nfor Intelligence and Security (DIS), and\\ndeveloped this National Cybersecurity\\nStrategic Framework.\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity Working Group\\nsaw the active participation of all the\\nAdministrations already represented in\\nthe Committee For the Security of the\\nRepublic (Ministries of Foreign Affairs,\\nInterior, Defence, Justice, Economy\\nand Finance, Economic Development),\\nand included the Agency in charge For\\nthe Italian Digital Agenda as well as\\nthe Cybersecurity Unit within the Prime\\nMinister’s Ofﬁce.\\n\\nThe pointofdeparture oFthis National\\nCybersecurity Strategic Framework is\\nan assessment of today’s cyber threat.\\nThe growing importance of services\\n\\nprovided through cyberspace in everyday\\n\\nlife — From simple online payments to\\nthe management of strategic and critical\\nnational infrastructures — implies that also\\nthe cyber threat is becoming more and\\nmore pervasive and subtle, and yet it is still\\nwidely unnoticed and underestimated. In\\nthe ﬁrst chapter, ”The Nature and the\\nEvolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and\\nofthe Vulnerabilities oFthe National ICT\\nInfrastructures\", the major cyber threats\\nand their actors will be acknowledged —\\nfrom cybercrime to cyber espionage and\\ncyber terrorism, From hacktivism to cyber\\nsabotage, concluding with cyber warfare\\n— and a brief taxonomy of the cyber\\norganizational, procedural and technical\\nvulnerabilities will be proposed.\\nCyberspace is a man-made domain\\nessentially composed of ICF nodes and\\nnetworks, hosting and processing an\\never-increasing wealth ofdata of strategic\\nimportance for States, ﬁrms, and citizens\\nalike, and For all political, social and\\neconomic decision-makers. The second\\nchapter, “Tools and Procedures to\\nStrengthen the National Cyber Defence\\nidentiﬁes six\\n\\nCapabilities”, strategic\\n\\nguidelines around which to converge,\\x0c\\nNational strategic framework for cyberspace security\\n\\nwith a holistic, coherent and synergic\\napproach, all national efforts, so as to\\nenhance the country’s preparedness,\\nresilience and reaction capabilities. These\\nguidelines include: the enhancement of\\nthe technical, operational and analytic\\nexpertise of all institutions concerned\\nwith the\\n\\ncybersecurity; strengthening\\n\\nof the cyber protection of ICI— networks\\n\\n10\\n\\n \\n\\nand computer systems supporting our\\ncritical and strategic infrastructure; the\\nFacilitation onublic-private partnerships;\\nthe promotion of a Culture of Security\\nand of cyber hygiene; the improvement\\nof our skills to effectively contrast online\\ncriminal activities; the full support to\\ninternational cooperation initiatives in\\nthe ﬁeld ofcybersecurity.\\x0c\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\nTHE NATURE AND THE EVOLVING TRENDS\\nOF THE CYBER THREAT AND OF THE\\nVULNERABILITIES OF THE NATIONAL ICT\\n\\nINFRASTRUCTURES\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nDeﬁnition\\n\\nWith the term cyberspace we refer to the\\ncomplex ofall interconnected ICT hardware\\nand software inﬁ\\'astru cture, to all data stored\\nin and transferred through the networks and\\nall connected usersy as well as to all logical\\nconnections however established among\\nthem. It therefore encompasses the Internet\\nand all communication cables, networks\\nand connections that support information\\nand data processing, including all mobile\\nInternet devices.\\n\\nA complex challenge\\n\\nThe very same nature of cyberspace\\n\\nthe of\\n\\ncontemporary societies brought about by\\n\\nand related transformation\\nthe digital ecosystem are accountable For\\nthe emergence of unprecedented cultural,\\nsocial and political issues, which require a\\nset ofcoherent, effective and in many cases\\noriginal solutions. As the International\\nCommunity is still very much divided with\\nregard to the principles and values that\\n\\napply to the cyber domain, seeking these\\n\\n11\\n\\nsolutions, even in the most advanced\\ncountries, is not an easy task, and it requires\\na broad involvement of the private sector.\\nThe private sector, in fact, has a key role to\\nplay in coming up with possible solutions\\nto cope with the new challenges and threats\\nstemming From the cyberspace which For\\nthe most part it owns and operates. The\\nprivate sector therefore has the interest and\\nthe duty to agree with the public sector on\\nmutual expectations and responsibilities\\nin ensuring the protection of cyberspace.\\nCyberspace has become a domain of\\nstrategic importance for the economic,\\nsocial and cultural development ofnations,\\nand it is hence critical to balance the right\\nmix of pubic and private engagement in its\\ngovernance and management, taking into\\naccount at the same time the requirements\\nofnational security and public order as well\\nas the Fulﬁllment of all the individual and\\neconomic liberties involved.\\n\\nBalancing these often diverging\\nobjectives is a complex endeavor, if one\\nconsiders for instance how monitoring\\nthe technical functionality ofnetworks is\\nessential to allow the Fulﬁllment of the\\n\\nright to privacy and the integrity ofone’s\\x0c\\nNational strategic framework for cyberspace security\\n\\ncommunication appliances, or also\\nhow it can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd the right\\nbalance between the right to privacy and\\nthe ﬁght against criminal activities such\\nas child pornography, drugs smuggling,\\nhate incitement or terrorism planning -\\ncrimes that not only hurt individual and\\nsocial liberties, but also undermine the\\nvery existence of an open, democratic\\n\\nand free Internet.\\n\\nObjectives\\n\\nThe present National Cybersecurity\\nStrategic Framework and the related\\nNational Plan, both Foreseen by the\\nPrime Minister’s “Decree Containing\\nStrategic Guidelines for the National\\nCyber Protection and ICF Security” of\\nthe 24th January 2013, aim at enhancing\\nthe national preparedness to respond to\\npresent and future challenges affecting\\ncyberspace, and are devoted to directing\\nall national efforts toward common\\n\\nand agreed solutions, knowing that\\ncybersecurity is a process rather than an\\nend to itself, that technical innovations\\nwill always introduce new vulnerabilities\\nin the strategic and operational horizon,\\nand that the intrinsic nature ofthe cyber\\nthreats makes our defence, at least For\\nthe time being7 mostly — although not\\n\\nexclusively—reactive.\\n\\nThe cyber threat and its actors\\n\\nDeﬁnition\\nWe deﬁne the cyber threat as the\\n\\ncomplex ofmalicious conducts that can be\\n\\n12\\n\\nexercised in and throughout cyberspace,\\nor against cyberspace and its Fundamental\\nelements.Thethreatiscarried out bymeans\\nof cyber attacks, by which we mean more\\nor less automated actions of individuals\\nand organizations, both governmental\\nand non-governmental, aiming at\\ndisrupting, damaging or impeding the\\nregular Functioning of computer systems,\\nICT networks or supervisory control\\nand data acquisition systems and data\\nprocessing, or at compromising the\\nauthenticity, the integrity, the availability\\nor the conﬁdentiality of data residing in\\nthose systems or transiting through the\\nnetworks.\\n\\nThe most sophisticated cyber attacks\\ncan be carried out through so called cyber-\\nweapons, that is a malicious software (i.e.\\nmalware) designed to damage or alter\\nan IT system with the aim of causing its\\n\\nmalfunction, or even physical damage.\\n\\nAn insidious threat\\n\\nA fundamental characteristic of the\\ncyber threat is its asymmetric nature. The\\nattacker:\\n\\n\\' May strike From anywhere in the\\nworld, as long as he is connected to\\nthe Internet;\\n\\n\\' Exploitsonesinglevulnerabilityto hack\\ninto very sophisticated and otherwise\\nwell protected computer systems;\\n\\n\\' Attacks instantaneously, allowing\\nno time to mount an appropriate\\nreaction;\\n\\n0 Can hardly be traced or even detected,\\nmaking it extremely complex For the\\n\\ndefender to put in place a response.\\x0c\\nThe Nature and the Evolving Trends of the CyberThreat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures\\n\\nThe intrinsic nature of: the cyber\\nthreat, therefore, limits the scope of\\ndeterrence, Favors the attack over defence,\\nand requires that all major stakeholders,\\nboth public and private, implement a\\ncontinuous process ofanalysis so as to be\\nabletoupdatetheirsecuritystandardsand\\nprocedures to the evolving operational\\n\\nand technical circumstances\\n\\nClassiﬁcation ofthe threat\\n\\nDepending on the actors involved\\nand the goals pursued, it is possible to\\ndistinguish Four kinds ofthreats:\\n\\n\\' Cybercrime: all malicious activities\\n\\nwith a criminal intent carried out\\nin cyberspace, such as swindles or\\ninternet Fraud, identity theFt, stealing\\noFclata or oFintellectual property;\\nCyberespionage: improperacquisition\\nof conﬁdential or classiﬁed data, not\\nnecessarily ofeconomic orcommercial\\n\\nvalue;\\n\\' Cyber terrorism: ideologically\\nmotivated exploitations of systems’\\n\\nof\\n\\ninﬂuencing a state or an international\\n\\nvulnerabilities with the intent\\norganization;\\n\\nCyber\\n\\noperations carried out in the cyber\\n\\nwarfare: activities and\\ndomain with the purpose of achieving\\nan operational advantage of military\\n\\nsigniﬁcance\\n\\nThe economic impact of cybercrime\\nTh e of\\n\\ncompanies’ data and personal assets\\n\\never-increasing volume\\n\\ninformation stored in cyberspace, recently\\n\\nencouraged by the growing resort to cloud\\n\\n13\\n\\ncomputing, makes cyberattack potentially\\nvery lucrative while being relatively risk‘ﬁ\\'ee\\nFor the attacker. It is therefore no surprise\\nthat the economic impact ofcybercrime is\\nquite worrisome. This is especially true For\\ncountries like Italy, for which the theft of\\nthe original scientiﬁc, technological and\\ncompanies’ know-how is a direct damage\\nto their existing comparative advantage,\\nundermining their competitiveness in the\\nglobal markets.\\n\\nComputer crime is a growing concern\\nalso because its illicit proﬁts are often\\nre-invested in the search of new system’s\\nvulnerabilities and in the development of\\nmore sophisticated7 efﬁcient and easy-\\nto-use offensive capabilities, making\\ncybercrimeathreat onrimaryimportance\\nfor the stability, the prosperity and the\\n\\nsecurity oFthe country.\\n\\nThe computer crime market\\n\\nThe computercrime market represents\\ntherefore a very palatable and proﬁtable\\nsector For autonomous hackers and For\\ncriminal organizations alike. They both\\nbolster a black market in which it is\\npossible to trade illegal contents (such as\\ndrugs, child pornography or copyrighted\\nmaterial) and to sell ready-to-use tooll<its\\nFor conducting all kind of attacks and\\nexploitations to the computer systems\\nof choice, either independently or\\nwith the technical support of criminal\\norganizations.

By the same\\ntoken, it is more and more evident the\\ninvolvement of criminal organizations\\nin cyber espionage activities, often on\\nbehalf of legitimate companies, with the\\nobjective of stealing industrial patent,\\ncompany strategies, market researches,\\nanalysis and description of productive\\n\\nprocesses, etc.\\n\\n14\\n\\n \\n\\nThe role aftl\\'ie State\\n\\nEven though the digital arena is a\\nreality that transcends, from many points\\nof view, national borders, states are\\ncertainly among the main stakeholders\\nof cyberspace) because they have the\\nultimate responsibility For the protection\\nof ICT\\n\\nterritory, even if they are owned and\\n\\ninfrastructures on their own\\n\\noperated mostly by the private sectors\\nStates have the human and ﬁnancial\\n\\nresources as well as the capability to\\n\\norganize and manage, overtime, complex\\x0c\\nThe Nature and the Evolving Trends of the CyberThreat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures\\n\\norganizations. As such, they are in a\\nunique position to mount a robust cyber\\noperational capability.\\n\\nProtecting the military command\\nand control networks and ensuring\\ntheir Full operational capability and\\ntheir resilience has always been a top\\npriority For any State. The advent\\nof cyberspace, and its key role in\\nensuring the functioning of virtually\\nevery national sensitive infrastructure,\\nindustrial process and public services,\\nhas extended the mandate of the State\\nto the protection of all ICT critical\\nnetworks. In Fact, the most sophisticated\\ncyber attacks may not only impair\\nand paralyze the State’s most vital\\ncommunication nodesandthe provision\\nofessential public services, but may also\\nhave potentially destructive effects iF\\ndirected against critical infrastructures\\nsuch as, for instance, the aviation trafﬁc\\nmanagement control system or dams\\nand energy installation’s supervisory\\ncontrol\\n\\nand management systems,\\n\\nresulting in great physical damages\\nlife.\\n\\nThe strategic advantage implicit in the\\n\\nand the eventual loss of human\\npossibility of inﬂicting a great loss to\\nthe enemy’s critical infrastructures by\\nstriking at great distance makes it very\\nlikely that future military confrontation\\nwill entail the Full use of cyberspace. It\\nis therefore no surprise that nowadays\\nvirtually every nation considers it\\nrelevant in its Force planning to Foresee\\nthe requirements of a cyber defence\\ncapability that is adequate to protect\\n\\nnational critical ICT infrastructures\\n\\n15\\n\\nEspionage, sabotage, warfare and supply\\nchain g/ber threat\\n\\nThe defence of cyber networks\\nrequires the development of an effective\\nand uninterrupted capability of\\n\\nmonitoring and analyzing all ongoing\\nmalicious activities. States are striving\\nto ensure themselves with this expertise,\\neither directly or through proxies, and\\nconsidering in many cases also the\\n\\npotential advantages of developing\\naggressive tools. It is a weII-know fact that\\nsome States already possess the capability\\nto penetrate public and private networks\\nof other States, and use this capability\\nFor espionage and in order to map ICT\\nsystems that could be potential targets in\\ncase offuture attacks. In such a situation,\\nis also highly plausible that certain States\\nmay consider mobilizing their national\\nindustry to install through the ICTsupply\\nchain components that could allow For\\nFuture stealthy cyber exploitation of the\\nend-user computer systems and ICT\\n\\ninfrastructure.\\n\\nHacktivism\\nSome cyber attacks are ideologically\\n\\nmotivated and have primarily a\\n\\nlike\\n\\nthe image of the target and/or causing\\n\\ndemonstrative intent,\\n\\ndamaging\\na temporary malfunctioning of the\\nattacked ICT systems. Examples of this\\ntype of cyber attack are the Distributed\\nDenial of Service (DDoS) attacks, that,\\nthrough coordinated attacks originating\\nFrom a number ofunaware and remotely\\ncontrolled computer (botnets), cause the\\n\\nintentional overload of servers that host\\x0c\\nNational strategic framework for cyberspace security\\n\\nspeciﬁc services. Another example is the\\nso-called Web Defacement, that alters\\nthe data oFa chosen Internet website with\\nthe speciﬁc goal to cause disinformation,\\ndefamation or simply mockery. In other\\ncases, hacktivists make use of malware\\nquite similar to the ones used by hackers\\nand computer criminals to surreptitiously\\nseize data that are owned by the\\ngovernment, or that belong to companies\\nor individuals, in order to publically\\nexpose them, orjust to demonstrate the\\n\\ncomputer skills that they have.\\n\\nThe use offhe Internet for illegal activities\\n\\nThe digital arena is an extraordinary\\nmeans to establish connections at the\\nThere\\n\\nalso the risk that this communication\\n\\nglobal levels is unfortunately\\nplatform and the high level ofanonymity\\nitallows are used bysometospread racial\\nhate, exchange illegal material (such as,\\nFor example, child pornography) or plan\\ncrimes, civil unrest or terrorist attacks.\\nEven ifwe cannot call these phenomena\\ncyber attacks in the literal sense of\\nthe word, inasmuch as cyberspace in\\nthis case is only used as a means of\\nis no doubt\\n\\ncommunication, there\\n\\nthat the inherent lack of attribution\\nallowed by cyberspace makes the threat\\nWe\\n\\nhesitate to clearly assert that the same\\n\\nparticularly insidious. cannot\\nnorms and rules ofbehavior that already\\nexist in the civil society Fully apply to\\nthe cyber domain. The challenge before\\nus is therefore to preserve the greatest\\npossible degree ofﬁ\\'eedom oFexpression\\n\\nwhile making sure that the Internet is not\\n\\n16\\n\\nused to perpetrate activities that would\\n\\nbe illegal in otherconventional domains.\\n\\nTerrorism\\n\\nIt is possible that in the next Future\\nterrorist groups or individual “lone\\nwolves” might make use of cyber offence\\ncapabilities to hit military and civil\\ntargets. These cyberweapons might either\\nbe ready available to terrorists through\\ncriminals operating within the computer\\ncrime market, or might be developed\\nindependently by the terrorists through a\\nprocess of reverse engineering of already\\nexisting cyber weapons. Fortunately, this\\nis For the time being only a hypothetical\\nthreat, but it is essential to make sure that\\npotentially destructive cyber tools remain\\n\\nout ofthe reach ofdangerous users.\\n\\nUnexpected event, incident\\n\\nThe Full account of threats that stem\\nFrom cyberspace is virtually impossible\\nbecause this domain is characterized by\\ncontinuous technological innovations;\\ntherefore unexpected developments might\\nconfront us with new technological and\\ngovernance challenges demanding a\\ncollective and systemic effort.

It is therefore necessary\\nto develop the necessary skills to anticipate\\nand prevent rare and unexpected events,\\nFocusing on the resilience and the business\\ncontinuity ofthe services that are essential\\nFor the security and the stability of the\\n\\ncountry.\\x0c\\nThe Nature and the Evolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures\\n\\nCyber vulnerabilities\\n\\nCyber attacks undermine users’ trust\\nin ICT technologies and impair business\\ncontinuity by exploiting organizational,\\nprocedural and technical vulnerabilities\\ncombinations.\\n\\n— often in various\\n\\nOrganizational and procedural\\n\\nvulnerabilities depend both on the\\ndeﬁcient implementation of protection\\nagainst malware — such as inappropriate\\nnetworkdesign, update ofanti-viruses and\\nanti-spam software , and on the lack of\\n\\nappropriate physical protection intended\\n\\nto ensure continuity of the service and to\\nminimize the impact of natural events on\\nphysical infrastructure\\nTechnical vulnerabilities are instead\\ndue to the vulnerabilities ofhardware and\\nsoftware, and to faults in communication\\nprotocols.

The private sector therefore has the interest and the duty to agree with the public sector on mutual expectations and responsibilities in ensuring the protection of cyberspace.. Cyberspace has become a domain of strategic importance for the economic, social and cultural development ofnations, and it is hence critical to balance the right mix of pubic and private engagement in its governance and management, taking into account at the same time, the requirements, ofnational security and public Order as well as the Fulllment of all the individual and economic liberties involved, Balancing these often diverging objectives is a complex endeavor.

      "Security strategy minister's foreword australians have been quick to embrace the internet in their their lives and businesses for most of us. It is now part of our daily for talking to our friends and family studying shopping and paying bills. Equally business has adopted the internet and other information technology to improve efficiency improve. The quality of service and gain access to new markets. Unfortunately. Our use of the internet. Has also created new opportunities for criminals who seek to access our personal and corporate secrets steal our resources and intimidate internet dependent businesses. The prime minister in his 2008 national security statement to parliament acknowledged that online threats now form one of our top tier national security priorities. Organised crime is increasingly employing information and communication technologies to facilitate their illegal activities. Particularly in relation to money laundering and identity crime. This strategy shows how the australian government is harnessing the full range of resources to help protect government business and individual australians. It describes how new capabilities have been created to help australians and the businesses. They transact with be better protected importantly this strategy calls upon all australian internet users to be vigilant and informed about online threats and how their own actions can be the first line of defence.

The prime minister has indicated that cyber security is now one of australia's top tier national security priorities. The global community continues to experience an increase in the scale sophistication and successful perpetration of cyber crime. As the quantity and value of electronic information has increased so too have the efforts of criminals and other malicious actors. Who have embraced the internet as a more anonymous convenient and profitable way of carrying out their activities. Australia's national security economic prosperity and social wellbeing are critically dependent. Upon the availability integrity and confidentiality of a range of information and communications technologies ict. . This includes desktop computers. The internet mobile communications devices and other computer systems and networks a more insidious and damaging threat. The production sale and distribution of malicious code has become a prolific criminal industry. Making malware stealthier more targeted multi faceted and harder to analyse and defeat. The risk to the australian economy from computer intrusion and the spread of malicious code by organised crime. Has been assessed as high this is particularly the case for financial transactions and sensitive commercial or personal identity. Information. There is a growing array of state and non state actors who are compromising stealing changing or destroying information and therefore potentially causing critical disruptions to australian systems. The distinction between traditional threat actors hackers terrorists organised criminal networks industrial spies and foreign intelligence services is increasingly blurred with the borderless anonymous nature of the internet attribution of the source of attacks is difficult. A government led coherent integrated approach. Confronting and managing these risks must be balanced against the civil liberties of australians. Including the right to privacy and the need to promote efficiency and innovation to ensure that australia realises the full potential of the digital economy. The aim of the australian government's cyber security policy is the maintenance of a secure. Resilient and trusted electronic operating environment. That supports australia's national security and maximises. The benefits of the digital economy. While the australian government's cyber security policy. Is primarily concerned with the availability integrity and confidentiality of australia's ict. It must be coordinated with those of other related policies and programs such as cyber safety. Which is focused on helping to protect individuals especially children from exposure to illegal. And offensive content. Cyber bullying stalking and grooming online for the purposes of sexual exploitation v. Cyber security strategy guiding principles consistent with the enduring principles outlined in the prime minister's national security statement. The australian government's cyber security policy is based on the following guiding principles national leadership. The scale and complexity of the cyber security challenge requires strong national leadership shared responsibilities. All users in enjoying the benefits of ict should take reasonable steps to secure their own systems. Exercise care in the communication and storage of sensitive information. And have an obligation to respect the information and systems of other users partnerships in light of these shared responsibilities. A partnership approach to cyber security across all australian governments. The private sector and the broader australian community is essential active international engagement given. The transnational nature of the internet in which effective. Cyber. Security. Requires coordinated global action. Australia. Must adopt an active multi layered approach to international engagement on cyber security risk management. In a globalised world. Where. All internet. Connected systems are potentially vulnerable. And where cyber attacks are difficult to detect. There is no such thing as absolute cyber security australia. Must. Therefore apply a risk. Based approach to assessing prioritising. And resourcing. Cyber security activities. Protecting australian values. Australia. Must. Pursue. Cyber security policies. That enhance individual and collective security. While preserving australians' right to privacy. And other fundamental values and freedoms. Maintaining this balance. Is a continuing challenge for all modern democracies seeking to meet the complex cyber security challenges of the future objectives. The objectives of the australian government's cyber security policy are that all australians are aware of cyber risks. Secure their computers and take steps to protect their identities privacy and finances online australian businesses operate secure and resilient information and communications technologies to protect the integrity of their own operations and the identity and privacy of their customers. The australian government ensures its information and communications technologies are secure and resilient vi strategic priorities to achieve these objectives. The australian government applies. The following strategic priorities to its programs improve. The detection. Analysis. Mitigation and response to sophisticated cyber threats with a focus on government critical infrastructure and other systems of national interest. Educate and empower all australians with the information confidence and practical tools to protect themselves online partner with business to promote security and resilience in infrastructure. Networks products and services model best practice in the protection of government ict systems. Including the systems of those transacting with government online promote a secure. Resilient and trusted global electronic operating environment. That supports australia's national interests maintain an effective legal framework and enforcement capabilities to target and prosecute cyber crime promote the development of a skilled cyber security workforce with access to research and development to develop innovative solutions new capabilities integral to the australian government's cyber security strategy are two new mutually supporting organisations cert australia and. The cyber security operations centre csoc . The australian government is bringing together australia's national computer emergency response team cert arrangements into a new body cert. Australia. Cert australia will be the national coordination point within. The australian government for the provision of cyber security information. And advice for the australian community and be the official point of contact in the expanding global community of national certs to support more effective international cooperation established as an initiative of the australian government's defence white paper. The csoc provides. The australian government with all source cyber situational awareness and an enhanced ability to facilitate operational responses to cyber security events of national importance. The csoc will identify and analyse sophisticated cyber attacks and assist in responses to cyber events across government and critical private sector systems and infrastructure. These new initiatives will build on existing australian government cyber security capabilities. Conclusion with the rapid escalation in the intensity and sophistication of cyber crime and other cyber security threats. It is imperative that government business and the community are aware of the severity of cyber security risks and commit to work together to protect what has become a vital component of our economy and society vii introduction the sophistication of our modern community is a source of vulnerability in itself . We are highly dependent on computer and information technology to drive critical industries. Such as aviation electricity and water supply banking and finance and telecommunications networks. This dependency on information technology makes us potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks that may disrupt the information that increasingly lubricates our economy and system of government the hon kevin rudd mp prime minister of australia the australian government acknowledges the scale of the cyber security challenge. Which the prime minister has indicated is now one of australia's top tier national security priorities. Australia's national security economic prosperity and social wellbeing are critically dependent. Upon the availability integrity and confidentiality of a range of information and communications technologies ict. . This includes desktop computers. The internet mobile communications devices and other computer systems and networks as these technologies become more pervasive in our lives government business and individuals are becoming more dependent upon them for a variety of purposes and functions ranging from online purchases of goods and services including government services . Communicating with others searching for information and managing finances through to controlling equipment in the mining and manufacturing industries. Computers and computer based communications are ubiquitous in australian life. Sometimes. These uses are quite clear to see and understand whereas in other cases such as the control of utilities. Transport and hospital equipment or the supply of food and pharmaceuticals the extent of dependence on ict is not as obvious. The australian government recognises. The importance and benefits of the advances in technology to australia's digital economy. The australian government has established a new company to invest up to 43 billion over eight years to build and operate a national broadband network nbn to deliver superfast broadband access for all australians. The nbn represents. The single largest investment in broadband infrastructure in australia's history and will further transform the way australians communicate and do business 1 cyber security strategy. The digital economy. The australian government has outlined its vision for australia's digital economy in the report australia's digital economy future directions. The digital economy is the global network of economic and social activities that are enabled by platforms. Such as the internet mobile and sensor networks. A successful digital economy is essential for australia's economic growth and our ability to maintain our international standing. The digital economy is highly dynamic. It will ultimately encompass the entire economy and many if not all aspects of our society. The key elements that a successful digital economy in australia. Will encompass are a digitally aware and enabling government a digitally confident innovative and skilled industry and a digitally literate and empowered community effective. Cyber. Security is a critical enabler to the australian government's goal of maximising opportunities for all australians to benefit from the digital economy. The global community continues to experience an increase in the scale sophistication and successful perpetration of cyber crime. As the quantity and value of electronic information has increased so too have the efforts of criminals and other malicious actors. Who have embraced the internet as a more anonymous convenient and profitable way of carrying out their activities. The financial loss from computer security events against australian businesses during the 2006 07 financial year is estimated by the australian institute of criminology to be between 595 and 649 million1. Given. The tendency for much cyber crime to be under reported. This could be a significant underestimate just as we have seen the benefits of ict in promoting legitimate economic activity. We now see cyber crime emerging on an unprecedented scale. The emergence of an underground cyber crime industry' means that it is no longer necessary to possess technical skills to commit cyber crime. An underground economy has developed where criminal capabilities. Techniques and tools can be readily purchased or hired on a commercial basis these extend from compromised credit card details or even complete identities and tools to create malicious software. Malware through to the ability to hire networks of compromised. Computers botnets to undertake tasks. Such as spamming. Hosting offensive content and distributed denial of service ddos attacks 1 k. Richards. The australian business assessment of computer user security a national survey australian institute of criminology 2009 2 antivirus vendor symantec identified that malicious code signatures had increased globally by 265 percent between 2007 and 2008. Sixty per cent of all malware detected by symantec to. Date was detected in 2008. Alone2. The production sale and distribution of malicious code. Has become a prolific criminal industry. Making malware stealthier more targeted multi faceted and harder to analyse and defeat. The risk to the australian economy from computer intrusion and the spread of malicious code by organised crime. Has been assessed as high this is particularly the case for financial transactions and sensitive commercial or personal identity. Information attacks on critical computer systems in both the government and private sector. Are being contemplated as an alternative way of conducting warfare and a means by which criminals terrorist groups and hostile intelligence services could damage australia's national interests for example malicious activities against ict systems have caused the disruption of electric power systems in multiple regions. Overseas including a case that resulted in a major multi. City. Power outage3 according to antivirus. Vendor trend micro australian computers experienced 17692567 malware infections in. 2008. Australia. Reported the fifth highest level of infections. Worldwide4. Some recent ddos attacks have resulted in the degradation and complete disruption of online services in australia. Impacting systems that are critical to australia's national interest such as the financial sector such attacks are inexpensive to conduct potentially hugely destructive and can be instigated from almost anywhere in the world. There is a growing array of state and non state actors who are compromising stealing changing or destroying information and therefore potentially causing critical disruptions to australian systems. The distinction between traditional threat actors hackers terrorists organised criminal networks industrial spies and foreign intelligence services increasingly appears to be blurring with the borderless anonymous nature of the internet attribution of the source of attacks is difficult the speed of technological change associated with next generation networks is challenging traditional notions of what constitutes computer networks. And how we should secure them this includes the combination of increased bandwidth convergent voice data video networks mobile wireless devices embedded processors and sensors social networking and other web 20 applications.

The only prediction that can be made with any confidence is that modern ict will continue to evolve in ways not foreseen by its designers. And that it will be used for malicious as well as legitimate purposes. These factors combined with the global nature of the internet and the limitations in the direct influence of governments over modern ict networks. That are predominantly designed built owned and operated by the private sector serve to emphasise the complexity of the cyber security challenge. Facing australia in the twenty first century national security statement on 4 december 2008. The prime minister delivered australia's inaugural national security statement to the parliament. The statement outlines five enduring national security interests that constitute the australian government's national security objectives. Maintaining australia's territorial and border integrity promoting australia's political sovereignty. Preserving a cohesive and resilient society and strong economy. Protecting australians and australian interests both at home and abroad and promoting a stable peaceful and prosperous international environment. Particularly in the asia pacific region. Together with a global rules based order which enhances australia's national interests. The statement. Indicates electronic espionage both commercial and state based will be a growing vulnerability as the australian government and society become more dependent on integrated information technologies. It states that this challenge must and will be met with full vigour and identifies cyber security as amongst. The australian government's top tier national security priorities. Australia is vulnerable to the loss of economic competitiveness through the continued exploitation of ict networks and the compromise of intellectual property and other sensitive commercial data. This has the potential to undermine australians' confidence in the digital economy. Cyber security is therefore not just an issue of national security. But also one of economic security. It is a challenge that requires a coherent integrated approach led by government but working in close partnership with the private sector that seeks to address the strategic vulnerabilities of an increasingly hostile online environment. Confronting and managing these risks must be balanced against the civil liberties of australians. Including the right to privacy and the need to promote efficiency and innovation to ensure that australia realises the full potential of the digital economy. 4. The australian government approach to cyber security. This strategy articulates. The overall aim and objectives of the australian government's cyber security policy and sets out the strategic priorities. That the australian government will pursue to achieve these objectives. The strategy also describes the key actions and measures that will be undertaken through a comprehensive body of work across the australian government to achieve these strategic priorities in developing this strategy. The australian government. Undertook a comprehensive review of australia's cyber security policies capabilities and arrangements. In 2008. This strategy. Will guide the efforts of australian government agencies towards the achievement of the australian government's policy objectives. This includes the work of australia's intelligence security. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Importantly. The strategy. Also provides a clear public articulation of the australian government's approach to cyber security. This is in recognition. That. While the australian government has an important leadership role effective cyber security efforts can only be achieved through partnerships between government business. And the community in australia. And internationally aim. The aim of the australian government's cyber security policy. Is the maintenance of a secure. Resilient and trusted electronic operating environment. That supports australia's national security and maximises. The benefits of the digital economy scope. The australian government defines cyber security as measures relating to the confidentiality availability and integrity of information. That is processed stored and communicated by electronic or similar means. The australian government recognises that from the perspective of an australian internet user protecting yourself online is not simply a matter of securing your computer. It is also about sensible online practices such as protecting your identity and privacy and understanding how to respond to fraudulent emails cyber bullying or stalking this includes parents who are concerned about their children's activities online. Where as a result of their actions. They may expose the computer to a virus or expose themselves to offensive content. Cyber bullying or individuals seeking to groom them for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This strategy does not seek to address all of these risks. It is focused on the availability integrity and confidentiality of australia's ict. However. It is essential that it works in harmony with other related policies and programs including cyber safety identity. Security and privacy in particular. The australian government's cyber security policy must be coordinated with its approach to cyber safety. Which is focused on protecting individuals especially children from exposure to illegal and offensive content cyber bullying and grooming online for the purposes of sexual exploitation. 5. Cyber security strategy in addition. There is a strong linkage between this strategy and the commonwealth organised crime strategic framework and the efforts of all governments to respond to the threats posed by organised crime. In particular. This strategy will be a contributing element to the development of the organised crime response plan and specific cyber security capabilities and arrangements will be of value for outreach to the community and the private sector on organised crime and in deepening the understanding of the use of new technologies to enable. The commission of organised crime. Cyber safety plan cyber safety concentrates on the broader social and personal risks. Associated with the use of technology particularly in relation to children these include issues such as cyber bullying sexual grooming. Exposure to illegal and inappropriate content. Loss of personal information and the promotion of inappropriate social and health. Behaviours in may. 2008 the australian government committed 1258. Million. Over four years to a comprehensive range of cyber safety measures. The cyber safety plan's measures include the expansion of the australian federal police afp child protection operations team to detect and investigate online child sex exploitation. The commonwealth director of public prosecutions. Helping deal with increased activity resulting from the work of the afp to ensure that prosecutions are handled quickly the examination of the introduction of internet service provider. Isp level filtering of refused classification material under the existing national classification code and whether additional isp content. Filtering options should be available for those families. Who wish to have such a service education and outreach activities through the australian communications and media authority. Acma to implement a comprehensive range of education activities. A consultative working group to consider the broad range of cyber safety issues. And provide advice to the australian government to ensure. Properly. Developed and targeted policy initiatives. A youth advisory group. And online forum to provide advice on cyber safety issues from a young person's perspective and research into the changing digital environment to identify issues and target future policy and funding more information on the cyber safety plan is. Available. At. Wwwdbcdegovau. 6. National identity security strategy. The national identity security strategy aims to maximise. The effectiveness and interoperability of work across all levels of government to combat the misuse of stolen or assumed identities. The preservation and protection of a person's identity is a right of all australians identity theft is a major invasion of privacy and a serious concern to the community to combat identity crime and to better protect identities. Australian governments have all agreed to the development and implementation of the national identity security strategy. The strategy enhances identification processes through improved registration and enrolment procedures. Including a new system for the electronic verification of documents used as evidence of identity enhanced security features on identity documents issued by government agencies reducing the risk of forgery. Ensuring accuracy in the identity information held by government agencies. Strong authentication standards and biometric interoperability to confirm the identity of individuals australian governments in collaboration with the private sector are working to enhance identity security for all particularly as business is increasingly conducted online. More information on the national identity security strategy. Including advice to individuals on how to help protect themselves from identity theft. And what to do if identity information has been stolen or fraudulently used is available at wwwaggovau 7 cyber security strategy guiding principles consistent with the enduring principles outlined in the national security statement the australian government's cyber security policy is based on the following guiding principles national leadership. The scale and complexity of the cyber security challenge requires strong national leadership. The australian government regulates the communications infrastructure on which both private and public ict depends. The national and transnational nature of these technologies makes. The australian government best placed to identify the strategic threats and emerging challenges to australia's cyber security. Furthermore. As a trustee of the private and personal information of australians. The australian government can model and influence best practice in cyber security. Shared responsibilities. All users in enjoying the benefits of ict should take reasonable steps to secure their own systems. Exercise care in the communication and storage of sensitive information. And have an obligation to respect the information and systems of other users partnerships in light of these shared responsibilities. A partnership approach to cyber security across all australian governments. The private sector and the broader australian community is essential active international engagement given. The transnational nature of the internet in which effective. Cyber. Security. Requires coordinated global action. Australia. Must adopt an active multi layered approach to international engagement on cyber security. This includes engagement with other countries. Who share. The australian government's concerns about cyber security and through organisations examining. These issues including the united nations international telecommunication union itu  asia pacific economic cooperation apec and the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd  risk management in a globalised world. Where all internet connected systems are potentially vulnerable. And where cyber attacks may be difficult to detect. There is no such thing as absolute cyber. Security therefore. When australia is assessing. Prioritising and resourcing cyber security activities. It should consider where the greatest areas of risk to the national interest lie. Protecting australian values australia. Must pursue cyber security policies. That enhance individual and collective security. While preserving australians' right to privacy. And other fundamental values and freedoms. Maintaining this balance. Is a continuing challenge for all modern democracies seeking to meet the complex cyber security challenges of the future roles and responsibilities of australian government agencies. The attorney general's department is the lead agency for cyber security policy across the australian government and chairs the cyber security policy and coordination. Cspc committee. Which is the interdepartmental committee. That coordinates the development of cyber security policy for the australian government integral to the australian government's cyber security strategy are two key organisations cert australia and. The cyber security operations centre csoc . A range of agencies contribute to the implementation of the strategy and the operation of cert australia. And the csoc. A detailed description of the role of australian government agencies is at attachment. A 8 cert. Australia. The australian government is bringing together australia's national computer emergency response team cert arrangements into a new government operated national cert. Cert australia. This will enable a more integrated holistic approach to cyber security across the australian community by creating a single coordination point within. The australian government for the provision of information and advice. Cert australia. Will incorporate a range of current cyber security activities. Undertaken by existing australian government. Agencies. Including the australian government's. Computer emergency readiness. Team govcertau in order to provide australians with access to information on cyber threats vulnerabilities in their systems and information on how to better protect themselves promote greater shared understanding between government and business of the nature and scale of cyber threats and vulnerabilities within australia's private sector networks. And how these can be mitigated. Provide targeted advice and assistance to enable the owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other systems of national interest to defend their systems from sophisticated electronic attacks. Working in close collaboration with intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Via. The. Newly established cyber security operations centre csoc.  and provide a single australian point of contact in the expanding global community of national certs to support more effective international cooperation cert. Australia. Will commence operations as the national cert in early 2010 more information on cert australia can be found at wwwcertgovau cyber security operations centre established as an initiative of the australian government's defence white paper the cyber security operations centre. Csoc provides. The australian government with all source cyber situational awareness and an enhanced ability to facilitate operational responses to cyber security events of national importance. The csoc's core functions. Include providing comprehensive understanding of the cyber threat and the security status of government networks and networks of national importance identifying and analysing sophisticated cyber attacks and providing government with response options and assisting responses to cyber events. Across o. Government and o critical private sector systems and infrastructure through the joint operating arrangements and the attorney. General's department more information on the csoc can be found. At. Wwwdsdgovau 9. Cyber security strategy objectives. The australian government's cyber security policy is based on three key objectives. Objective. One all australians are aware of cyber risks. Secure. Their computers and take steps to protect their identities privacy and finances online. The australian government recognises. The importance of building and maintaining the confidence of all australians to participate in the digital economy. The australian government is committed to informing and educating australians on cyber security risks and empowering them with the knowledge and practical tools to protect themselves online as the internet continues to be integrated into more aspects of daily life and more and more personal and financial information is being placed online. Cyber crime. Is becoming an increasing concern to many australians. There is potential for this to be further exacerbated by the growth in always on' broadband connections and the increased bandwidth associated with next generation networks. The inherent characteristics of a borderless lightly regulated and largely anonymous online environment make it impossible to prevent all security incidents from occurring. However government and business must strive to limit cyber security risks to the australian community from becoming so chronic or widespread as to undermine confidence in the digital economy. There is a reasonable expectation that governments and the private sector including the internet industry will educate users and their customers on the risks. And the steps they can take to minimise them a key role for the australian government is therefore to promote a robust culture of cyber security that provides all australians with the awareness and confidence to maximise the benefits that the digital economy has to offer while minimising their exposure to the risks of the online environment in this environment. All australians need to take reasonable steps to ensure the protection of their personal information and internet connected ict systems in order to do this. Effectively users need to be aware of the risks of being online. And the relatively straightforward steps that they can take to protect their systems and their information online. The importance of this objective goes well beyond the protection of individuals as compromised home computers can readily be organised into botnets' that may be used to launch attacks against government or other critical systems by empowering all users with the knowledge and confidence to protect their information and systems online. The australian government can help reduce the impact of cyber crime and mitigate the threat to systems critical to the national interest moreover by addressing some of the systemic vulnerabilities in australian networks. The australian government can strengthen australia's ability to advocate similar best practice' approaches to cyber security in the international arena in order to support efforts to promote a more secure and resilient online environment. 10 objective two australian businesses operate secure and resilient information and communications technologies to protect the integrity of their own operations and the identity and privacy of their customers business and government have shared interests and responsibilities for ensuring a secure and reliable electronic operating environment on which both business and government services. Depend as the australian government does not own the majority of the systems that are critical to the community. It needs to identify ways in which it can influence the policies and practices of those that do this includes state and territory government systems government business enterprises and organisations and companies operating in the private and non government sectors. These systems are critical to australia's national interest and are therefore in need of particular and specific attention including direct support from the australian government for these reasons. The australian government works with the private sector to identify the systems that are most critical to australia's national interest based on an assessment of risk. That considers factors. Such as uniqueness importance vulnerability and attractiveness to potential adversaries. The australian government maintains trusted relationships with the owners and operators of systems that are considered to be most critical to australia's national interests working through trusted information exchange mechanisms. The australian government provides. These organisations with a better understanding of the cyber threat environment to build a greater shared understanding of threats and vulnerabilities by gaining a greater awareness and understanding of these largely privately owned systems of national interest. The australian government can better tailor its assistance to the owners and operators of systems of national interest. This may extend to providing targeted advice and assistance in responding to sophisticated electronic threats. An understanding of the impact that a disruption to these systems would have on the national interest is an essential part of the australian government's ability to manage a crisis. Cyber events. Need to be managed in a coordinated and timely manner. The australian government will put in place a plan to ensure the continuity of government and critical services when a cyber event occurs. The australian government is also committed to working with the broader business community to optimise cyber security across the whole of the digital economy by promoting a greater awareness of cyber security risks and best practice approaches to how these can be mitigated with this knowledge and these tools. Australian businesses can be empowered to ensure the security of their own ict systems and protect valuable customer. Information. Australian businesses are increasingly being entrusted with large amounts of financial and other personal information on behalf of their customers. The aggregation of this data can present an attractive target for cyber criminals. And businesses should. Therefore be mindful of their responsibilities for protecting this information these responsibilities also extend to providing secure trusted environments in which their customers can transact online business is responsible for the security and reliability of their systems and infrastructure and the transactions that take place on them maintaining consumer confidence in transacting online is fundamental to the success of the digital economy 11. Cyber security strategy. What are systems of national interest in today's modern digital economy systems of national interest go beyond traditional notions of critical infrastructure. Such as electricity. Grids water storage and distribution aviation and maritime transport and telecommunications networks. They also include for example systems of high economic value such as those that support electronic transactions hold sensitive intellectual property such as biotechnology patents or other commercial data associated with major international trade negotiations they are the systems which if rendered unavailable or otherwise compromised could result in significant impacts on australia's economic prosperity international competitiveness public safety social wellbeing or national defence and security. The identification of systems of national interest is not a static process and a flexible approach is required to enable the australian government to respond to the changing environment in terms of technology usage threat and risk. It is for this reason that the identification of systems of national interest must be informed by an ongoing assessment of risk. 12. Control systems. Security control systems. Which include supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems are devices and networks used to electronically control mechanical processes such as water valves electricity generation and transmission or the operation of a coal loader using these systems operators are able to monitor processes and control infrastructure from across the road or across the globe control systems are increasingly being interconnected with corporate business networks and directly or indirectly to the internet. This together with rapid advances in technology changing business needs and the increasing threat environment associated with the internet is compounding the vulnerability of control systems to cyber threats. The australian government is working with control systems owners and operators to help them secure their systems. Under. The auspices of the trusted information. Sharing network for critical infrastructure protection. Tisn . The australian government has provided guidance and advice to tisn member organisations on control systems security in the form of advisories and alerts on specific vulnerabilities and threats to control systems and networks established. A scada community of interest to provide a forum to raise the awareness of security for control systems practitioners from critical infrastructure sectors vendors consultants and researchers and supported control systems practitioners participating in world's best practice training in advanced control systems. Cyber security conducted in the united states. The australian government through cert australia operates trusted information exchanges with the owners and operators of control systems. This enables government and business to share sensitive and detailed technical security. Information. Thereby building. A greater understanding of the control systems environment. And its threats cert. Australia. Is also partnering with australian academic organisations. Such as edith cowan university on vulnerability and mitigation research programs. Looking at initiatives such as smartgrids and smart metering technologies and their security implications. 13. Cyber security strategy objective three the australian government ensures its information and communications technologies are secure and resilient. The ict systems of government and the information. Contained within them are a strategic national asset. The australian government therefore has a clear responsibility for ensuring the security and resilience of its own ict including protecting the information. It holds about australian people and organisations. The australian government can only protect its information and ict from threats and vulnerabilities that it has identified. It is critical that the australian government is proactive in identifying and understanding these threats and vulnerabilities to ensure the development of appropriate mitigation strategies in order to achieve this objective. The australian government will enhance its understanding of the cyber threat environment and respond appropriately to protect australian government information. And ict additionally. The australian government needs to have in place. A consistent and integrated framework of policies procedures and technical standards to ensure the protection of its information and ict. One that recognises the security of systems as a fundamental component of all australian government initiatives dependent upon ict. This framework needs to be applied not only to australian government systems. But also the interconnected government systems such as e health. That are increasingly being developed to assist in shared service delivery between the commonwealth and the states and territories. However government systems represent only a fraction of the global ict infrastructure. On which australia's economic and national security. Depends. The australian government is committed to leading by example by embracing best practice in the protection of the australian government's own information systems. Including the protection of the personal and corporate information entrusted to it by specifying minimum security standards that apply across government. The australian government can create incentives for the market to make more secure services available to the public 14 strategic priorities in order to achieve these objectives. The australian government is undertaking. A comprehensive body of work based around the following set of integrated mutually supporting strategic priorities. There are clear linkages between many of these priorities and the broader objectives of the strategy for example in relation to government systems. However it is important to note that the priorities support the achievement of all objectives for example international engagement including the sharing of information and expertise and the development of collaborative approaches. Serves. As an enabler to all cyber security activities. Priority threat. Awareness. And response improve. The detection. Analysis. Mitigation. And response to sophisticated cyber threats. With a focus on government critical infrastructure and other systems of national interest. This priority covers initiatives to maintain capabilities for continuous real time monitoring of the online threat environment. Supported by established plans for responding to events. Should they occur under this priority. The australian government is undertaking a range of measures including establishing a cyber security operations centre. Csoc within the department of defence to provide a 24 7. Cyber situational awareness capability and coordinate responses to cyber security events of national. Importance creating a new national computer. Emergency response team cert australia to share information and improve the coordination of responses to cyber security threats between government and the private sector actively participating in and facilitating trusted and timely information sharing within and between government and business. Nationally and internationally to ensure the maintenance of situational awareness and a consistent global response to online threats developing. An updated cyber security crisis management plan that outlines the arrangements for responding to cyber security events of national significance. Including coordination with the states and territories and the private sector and conducting a program of cyber security exercises to test and refine event. Response arrangements. Including the cyber storm series of exercises coordinated by the united states 15. Cyber security strategy cyber storm. The united states department of homeland security sponsors a series of large scale cyber security exercises collectively called cyber storm cyber storm gives participants the opportunity to exercise their internal event response and communications in a national framework. That is part of an international exercise in march 2008. 56. Australian organisations from across government and the private sector participated in the second large scale international cyber exercise cyber storm ii along with a broad range of government and non government organisations from the united states canada new zealand and the united kingdom. This exercise. Provided an opportunity for stakeholders across the spectrum of cyber security and critical infrastructure. In australia to test their disaster recovery. Communications. And technical response processes to a cyber security event australia will participate in cyber storm iii to be held in late september 2010. 16 priority cultural change educate and empower all australians with the information confidence and practical tools to protect themselves online australians use ict for a wide variety of purposes. And at an ever increasing rate in order to ensure their personal and financial information and their identity and privacy are protected. It is essential that they maintain an awareness and understanding of the cyber environment. And its risks. This priority covers initiatives to conduct education and awareness raising activities to promote a culture of cyber security amongst. All australian ict users under this priority. The australian government is undertaking a range of measures. Including a single authoritative website for cyber security information. For australian home users and small business including those with limited cyber security knowledge and skills wwwstaysmartonline govau  this website includes plain language alerts and advisories for the public including information on new cyber security risks and how to address them the creation of cert australia to ensure. The australian internet community has access to information on cyber security threats vulnerabilities in their systems. And information on how to better protect their information. Technology environment. Practical tools. Such as the spammatters5 reporting tool to address the growing problems of spam broader engagement with the commercial internet industry including working with industry on the development of a voluntary internet service provider isp code of practice to promote best practice approaches to deal with cyber security issues. Cyber security education. Modules for australian primary and secondary schools. An ongoing program of awareness raising culminating in an annual cyber security awareness week conducted in partnership with business consumer groups and community organisations and examining options to better inform and educate the community on a broad range of online risks. Including cyber security identity. Security cyber safety. And. Online fraud 5 further information on spammatters is available at. Wwwacmagovau 17. Cyber security strategy australian internet security initiative. The australian internet security initiative. Aisi helps address the problem of compromised computers. Sometimes referred. To as zombies' or. Bots'  computers can become. Compromised. Through the installation of malicious software. Malware. Without a user's knowledge or consent. That enables the computer to be controlled remotely for illegal and harmful activities. Compromised. Computers are often combined into large groups known as botnets' among other things botnets' are used for the mass distribution of spam and spyware the hosting of phishing' sites designed to steal users' personal information. And distributed denial of service attacks on websites to render them inaccessible on. Average there were. 4291 aisi compromise reports per day over the 2008. 09 year on an annual. Basis this represents 157. Million discrete aisi reports the aisi collects data from various sources on computers exhibiting bot' behaviour on the australian internet using this data the australian communications and media authority acma provides daily reports to participating internet service providers isps identifying computers on their networks that have been reported to have been compromised in the previous 24 hour period. Isps can then inform their customer that their computer appears to be compromised and provide advice on how they can fix. It. There are 71 isps that participate in the program as at october 2009 . Acma intends to progressively increase the number of isps participating in the aisi to ensure that more compromised hosts on the australian internet are identified and their owners notified of the compromise more information on the aisi can be found at wwwacmagovau priority business government partnerships partner with business to promote security and resilience in infrastructure networks products and services. The australian government recognises that the economic and social wellbeing. National security and defence of australia is often dependent upon systems that are owned and operated outside. The australian government. This priority therefore recognises that government and business must work together to provide more secure products and services and maintain their ict systems in ways that ensure the privacy and security of customer information. It recognises that isps in particular occupy a unique position at the gateway to australians' access to the internet and therefore need to be a key partner in the australian government's efforts to maximise the cyber security of all australians. It also recognises that vulnerabilities in australia's critical infrastructure and other systems of national interest. Represent a greater level of risk to australia's national security than systems supporting broader online. Commerce and that a more intensive level of engagement is required between government and the owners and operators of these systems of national interest. It covers initiatives. 18 that enable the australian government to develop greater situational awareness of potential vulnerabilities in critical private sector networks. While also providing mechanisms for the australian government to provide tailored information and targeted assistance to the owners and operators of these networks for dealing with sophisticated cyber threats. Under this priority. The australian government is undertaking a range of measures including using cert australia to strengthen trusted partnerships with the private sector for the sharing of sensitive information on cyber threats vulnerabilities and their potential consequences. This includes tailored alerts and advisories for australian businesses and more intensive. Trusted information exchanges with high risk sectors to share information on sophisticated threats. These exchanges cover the telecommunications and banking and finance industries and the owners and operators of the control systems that underpin much of the nation's critical infrastructure strengthening engagement with the commercial internet industry to raise awareness of cyber security risks identify cyber threats and vulnerabilities and appropriate mitigation strategies including through working with industry on the development of a voluntary isp code of practice to promote best isp participation in the australian internet security initiative.

Including the systems of those transacting with government online. This priority recognises that the ict systems of government and the information contained within them is a strategic national asset. It covers initiatives to protect australian government systems and interconnected government systems that are increasingly being developed to assist in shared service delivery between the commonwealth and the states and territories. It also includes reforms to whole of government ict procurement arrangements that provide cost efficiencies and specify minimum security standards that apply across government these reforms have the potential to create incentives for the market to make more secure services. Available to the public under this priority. The australian government is undertaking a range of measures. Including examining options to reduce the number of australian government internet gateways to the minimum number practical. So as to maximise efficiency.

       " 'Cyberspace includes all information infrastructures accessible via the Internet beyond all territorial boundaries. In Germany all players of social and economic life use the possibilities provided by cyberspace. As part of an increasingly inter-connected world, the state, critical infrastructures, businesses and citizens in Germany depend on the reliable functioning of information and communication technology and the Internet.',\n",
       " 'Malfunctioning IT products and components, the break-down of information infrastructures or serious cyber attacks may have a considerable negative impact on the performance of technology, businesses and the administration and hence on Germany’s social lifelines. The availability of cyberspace and the integrity, authen-ticity and confidentiality of data in cyberspace have become vital questions of the 21st century. Ensuring cyber security has thus turned into a central challenge for the state, business and society both at national and international level. The Cyber Security Strategy is intended to improve the framework conditions in this area.22',\n",
       " '**********IT threat assessment',\n",
       " 'In recent years attacks against information infrastructures have become ever more frequent and complex, while at the same time perpetrators have become more professional. Cyber attacks are launched both from Germany and abroad. Given the openness and extent of cyberspace it is possible to conduct covert attacks and misuse vulnerable systems as tools for an attack. In view of technologically sophisticated malware the possibilities of responding to and retracing an attack are rather limited. Often attacks give no clue as to the identity and the background of the attacker. Criminals, terrorists and spies use cyberspace as a place for their activities and do not stop at state borders. Military operations can also be behind such attacks.',\n",
       " 'The trend to develop information systems for industry on the basis of standard components and connect them to cyberspace, which is motivated mainly by economic concerns, entails new vulnerabilities. Experience with the Stuxnet virus shows that important industrial infrastructures are no longer exempted from targeted IT attacks.',\n",
       " 'Given the increasing complexity and vulnerability of information infrastructures the cyber security situation will remain critical also in the future. In Germany, the public and the private sector as well as society at large are all equally affected by targeted or coincidental IT failures.',\n",
       " '33',\n",
       " '**********Framework conditions',\n",
       " 'Ensuring cyber security, enforcing rights and protecting critical information infrastructures require major efforts by the state both at national level and in cooperation with international partners. Given the shared responsibilities of the state, the industry and the society a cyber security strategy will only be successful if all players act as partners and fulfil their tasks together. The same applies to the international context.',\n",
       " 'Since IT systems are interconnected in global networks, incidents in other coun-tries’ information infrastructures may also indirectly affect Germany. For this rea-son, strengthening cyber security also requires the enforcement of international rules of conduct, standards and norms. Only a mix of domestic and external policy measures will be appropriate for the dimension of the problem. Cyber security can be improved by enhancing the framework conditions for drawing up com-mon minimum standards (code of conduct) with allies and partners. Fighting the rapid growth of cybercrime requires close cooperation between law enforcement authorities worldwide.',\n",
       " 'Basic principles of the \\nCyber Security StrategyThe Federal Government aims at making a substantial contribution to a secure cyberspace, thus maintaining and promoting economic and social prosperity in Germany. Cyber security in Germany must be ensured at a level commensurate with the importance and protection required by interlinked information infra-structures, without hampering the opportunities and the utilization of the cyber-space. In this context the level of cyber security reached is the sum of all national and international measures taken to protect the availability of information and communications technology and the integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of data in cyberspace.',\n",
       " '44',\n",
       " '**********Cyber security must be based on a comprehensive approach. This requires even more intensive information sharing and coordination. The Cyber Security Strat-egy mainly focuses on civilian approaches and measures. They are complemented by measures taken by the Bundeswehr1 to protect its capabilities and measures based on mandates to make cyber security a part of Germany’s preventive security strategy. Given the global nature of information and communications technology, international coordination and appropriate networks focusing on foreign and security policy aspects are indispensable. This includes cooperation not only in the United Nations, but also in the EU, the Council of Europe, NATO, the G8, the OSCE and other multinational organizations. The aim is to ensure the coherence and capabilities of the international community to protect cyberspace.1  ',\n",

The Federal Government will specifically focus on ten strategic areas:1. Protection of critical information infrastructuresThe protection of critical information infrastructures is the main priority of cyber security. They are a central component of nearly all critical infrastructures and become increasingly important. The public and the private sector must cre-ate an enhanced strategic and organizational basis for closer coordination based on intensified information sharing. To this end, cooperation established by the CIP implementation plan is systematically extended, and legal commitments to 66',\n",
       " '**********enhance the binding nature of the CIP implementation plan are examined. With the participation of the National Cyber Security Council (cf. objective 5), the in-tegration of additional sectors is examined and the introduction of new relevant technologies is considered to a greater extent. Whether and where protective measures have to be made mandatory and whether and where additional powers are required in case of specific threats have to be clarified, too. Furthermore we will examine the necessity of harmonizing rules to maintain critical infrastructures during IT crises.',\n",
       " '2. Secure IT systems in GermanyInfrastructure protection requires more security with regard to IT systems used by citizens and small and medium-sized businesses. Users need appropriate and consistent information on risks related to the use of IT systems and on security measures they can take to use cyberspace in a secure manner. We will organize joint initiatives with groups from society to pool information and advice con-sistently. Furthermore we will examine whether providers may have to assume greater responsibility and make sure that a basic collection of appropriate security products and services are made available to users by providers. We want to provide specific incentives and funds for basic security functions certified by the state (e. g. electronic proof of identity or De-mail) to be used by the vast majority of citizens.To support small and medium-sized businesses in the secure use of IT systems, the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology has set up a task force on “IT security in industry” with the participation of industry. ',\n",
       " '3. Strengthening IT security in the public administrationThe public administration will further enhance the protection of its IT systems. State authorities have to serve as role models for data security. We will create a common, uniform and secure network infrastructure in the federal administra-tion (“federal networks”) as a basis for electronic audio and data communication. We will continue to press ahead with the implementation plan for the federal administration. Should the IT security situation get worse, this plan may be 77',\n",
       " '**********aligned accordingly. Effective IT security requires powerful structures in all federal authorities. For this reason resources must be deployed appropriately at central and local level. To facilitate implementation through uniform action by authorities, joint investments into the Federal Government’s IT security will be made regularly in line with budgetary possibilities.

National Cyber Response Centre',\n",
       " 'To optimize operational cooperation between all state authorities and improve the coordination of protection and response measures for IT incidents we will set up a National Cyber Response Centre. It will report to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and cooperate directly with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) and the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK). Cooperation in the National Cyber Response Centre will strictly observe the statutory tasks and powers of all authorities involved on the basis of cooperation agreements. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the Federal Police (BPOL), the Customs Criminological Office (ZKA), the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), the Bundeswehr and authorities supervising critical infrastructure operators all participate in this centre within the framework of their statutory tasks and powers.',\n",
       " 'Quick and close information sharing on weaknesses of IT products, vulnerabilities, forms of attacks and profiles of perpetrators enables the National Cyber Response Centre to analyse IT incidents and give consolidated recommendations for action. The interests of the private sector to protect itself against crime and espionage in cyberspace should also be adequately taken into account. At the same time respective responsibilities must be observed. Every stakeholder takes the necessary measures in its remit on the basis of the jointly developed national cyber security assessment and coordinates them with the competent authorities as well as partners from industry and academia.',\n",
       " 'Since security preparedness is best achieved by early warning and prevention, the Cyber Response Centre will submit recommendations to the National Cyber Secu-rity Council both on a regular basis and for specific incidents. If the cyber security situation reaches the level of an imminent or already occurred crisis, the National Cyber Response Centre will directly inform the crisis management staff headed by the responsible State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior.88',\n",

The Federal Chancellery and a State Secretary from each the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Federal Ministry of Defence, the Federal Ministry for Economics and Technology, the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Education and Resarch and representatives of the federal Länder will participate.

The National Cyber Security Council will complement and interlink IT management at federal level and the work of the IT Planning Council in the area of cyber security at a political and strategic level.6. Effective crime control also in cyberspaceThe capabilities of law enforcement agencies, the Federal Office for Information Security and the private sector in combating cyber crime, also with regard to protection against espionage and sabotage, must be strengthened. To improve the exchange of know how in this area we intend to set up joint institutions with indus-try with the participation of the competent law enforcement agencies, which will act in an advisory capacity. Projects to support partner countries with structural weaknesses will also serve the aim of combating cyber crime. To face up to the growing challenges of global cyber crime activities we will make a major effort to achieve global harmonization in criminal law based on the Council of Europe Cyber Crime Convention. Furthermore, we will examine whether additional conventions in this area may be necessary at UN level. 1010',\n",

The EU Internal Security Strategy and the Digital Agenda provide guidance for further activities.We will shape our external cyber policy in such a way that German interests and ideas concerning cyber security are coordinated and pursued in international organizations, such as the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the OECD and NATO. An increasingly multilateral approach must be brought in line with the necessity of sovereign evaluation and decision-making powers. In this context, a code for state conduct in cyberspace (cyber code) should be estab-lished, which is signed by as many countries as possible and includes confidence-building security measures. In the G8 framework we are currently working on intensifying anti-botnet activities.',\n",
       " 'NATO serves as the basis of transatlantic security. Hence, NATO must take cyber security appropriately into account in its entire range of responsibilities. We are in favour of the alliance’s commitment to establishing uniform security stand-ards, which Member States may also use for civilian critical infrastructures on a voluntary basis, as foreseen in NATO’s new Strategic Concept.8. Use of reliable and trustworthy information technologyThe availability of reliable IT systems and components must be ensured on a permanent basis. The development of innovative protection plans for improved security which take into account social and economic aspects is strongly sup-ported. To this end, we will continue and intensify research on IT security and on critical infrastructure protection. Furthermore we will strengthen Germany’s technological sovereignty and economic capacity in the entire range of core strategic IT competences, include them in our political strategies and develop them further.

Our aim is to use components in critical security areas which are certified against an international recognized certification standard.9. Personnel development in federal authoritiesGiven the strategic importance of cyber security, it must be examined as a priority whether additional staff is necessary in authorities in the interest of cyber security. Furthermore, intensified personnel exchange between federal authorities and ap-propriate further training measures will enhance interministerial cooperation.10. Tools to respond to cyber attacksIf the state wants to be fully prepared for cyber attacks, a coordinated and com-prehensive set of tools to respond to cyber attacks must be created in coopera-tion with the competent state authorities. We will continue to assess the threat situation regularly and take appropriate protection measures. If necessary, we have to examine whether additional statutory powers must be created at federal or Länder level.

This means that the technical and social aspects of cyberspace will continue to change and bear not only new opportunities, but also new risks.
